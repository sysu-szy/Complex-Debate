{"question": "How many integers between 200 and 300 are perfect squares?", "answer": "Let $m$ be a positive integer. $200\\le m^2\\le300\\Rightarrow 15\\le m\\le17$. Therefore, exactly $\\boxed{3}$ integers ($15^2$, $16^2$, and $17^2$) are perfect squares between 200 and 300.", "agents_response": "To find the perfect squares between 200 and 300, we need to find the square root of the lowest and highest numbers in that range, which are \u221a200 = 14.14 and \u221a300 = 17.32, respectively.\n\nSince the perfect squares between 200 and 300 are whole numbers, we need to consider the integers from 15 to 17 inclusive, which gives us 3 perfect squares: 15\u00b2 = 225, 16\u00b2 = 256, and 17\u00b2 = 289.\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{3} integers between 200 and 300 that are perfect squares."}
