{"question": "When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7?", "answer": "Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, so $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 25 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{7}$.", "agents_response": "Let the favorite number be x.\n\nGiven that x/7 leaves a remainder of 5, we can express the favorite number as x = 7n + 5, where n is an integer.\n\nWhen we multiply x by 5, we get 5x = 5(7n + 5) = 35n + 25.\n\nNow, when we divide 5x by 7, we get a remainder of 35n + 25 = 7(5n + 3) + 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when Rachel multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7 is 4.\n\n\\boxed{4}"}
