{"question": "An amusement park charges an entry fee of $\\$2.25$ plus $\\$1.50$ for each ride. If Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, how many rides did he pay for?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of rides for which Simon paid. Then $12.75=2.25+1.50x\\implies 1.50x=10.50\\implies x=\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "Let $x$ be the number of rides that Simon paid for. The total cost can be expressed as $2.25 + 1.50x = 12.75$. Solve for $x$:\n\n$1.50x = 12.75 - 2.25 \\\\\n1.50x = 10.50 \\\\\nx = \\frac{10.50}{1.50} \\\\\nx = 7$\n\nTherefore, Simon paid for $\\boxed{7}$ rides."}
