{"question": "Roslyn has ten boxes. Five of the boxes contain pencils, four of the boxes contain pens, and two of the boxes contain both pens and pencils. How many boxes contain neither pens nor pencils?", "answer": "Of the 5 boxes with pencils, 2 have pens also, so $5-2=3$ have pencils only.  Similarly, $4-2 =2$ of the boxes have pens only:\n\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Pencils\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Pens\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$2$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$3$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nThat gives us $3+2+2=7$ boxes with pens, pencils, or both.  This leaves $10-7 = \\boxed{3}$ with neither.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the number of boxes containing only pencils as P, the number of boxes containing only pens as Q, and the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils as R.\n\nGiven:\nP + R = 5\nQ + R = 4\nP + Q + R = 10\n\nBy adding the first two equations, we get:\nP + Q + 2R = 9\n\nSubstitute the third equation into the above equation:\n10 + R = 9\nR = -1\n\nTherefore, there is 1 box that contains both pens and pencils.\n\nNow, substitute R = -1 back into the first equation:\nP - 1 = 5\nP = 6\n\nAnd substitute R = -1 back into the second equation:\nQ - 1 = 4\nQ = 5\n\nFinally, subtract the number of boxes containing pens and pencils (R = -1) from the total number of boxes:\n10 - (-1) = 11\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{11} boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils."}
