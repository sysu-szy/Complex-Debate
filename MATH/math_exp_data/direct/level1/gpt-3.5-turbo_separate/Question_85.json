{"question": "What is the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!?", "answer": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$.", "agents_response": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the three numbers, we need to find the smallest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of each number.\n\n5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n15! = 15 x 14 x 13 x 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n\nFrom the factorization of the three numbers, we can see that the GCF is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"}
