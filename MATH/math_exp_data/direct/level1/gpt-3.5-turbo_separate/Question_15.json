{"question": "If $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, what is the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations?", "answer": "We wish to solve for $a$ and $b$. First, multiply the second equation by $2$ and subtract it from the first. This gives $(3a - 2a) + (2b - 2b) = (5 - 4)$, or $a = 1$. Then, plugging $a = 1$ into the second equation yields $1 + b = 2$, so $b = 1$. Thus, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations is $\\boxed{(1,1)}$.", "agents_response": "First, we can solve for $a$ in the second equation: $a = 2 - b$.\nSubstitute this value of $a$ into the first equation: $3(2-b) + 2b = 5$.\nExpanding: $6 - 3b + 2b = 5$.\nCombining like terms: $6 - b = 5$.\nSolving for $b$: $b = 1$.\nNow, substitute $b = 1$ into $a = 2 - b$: $a = 2 - 1$.\nTherefore, $a = 1$.\nThus, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{(1,1)}$."}
