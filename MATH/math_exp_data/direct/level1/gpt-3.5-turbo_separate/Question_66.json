{"question": "How many integers satisfy the equation: $3n^3-12n = 0$ ?", "answer": "We factor the polynomial to get $3n(n^2-4)=0$. The product equals $0$ if $n=0$ or $n^2-4=0 \\Rightarrow n=\\pm 2$. The integers $0,2,-2$ satisfy the equation, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers.", "agents_response": "The given equation is $3n^3 - 12n = 0$, which can be factored as $3n(n^2 - 4) = 0$. \n\nThis equation will be satisfied when either $n = 0$, or when $n^2 - 4 = 0$. \nWhen $n=0$, the equation is satisfied. \nWhen $n^2 - 4 = 0$, we get $n^2 = 4$, so $n = \\pm 2$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the equation."}
