{"question": "What is the positive value of the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$ when $x = 5$ and $y = 2$?", "answer": "Plugging in, the desired expression is just $\\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = \\boxed{11}$.", "agents_response": "We substitute $x = 5$ and $y = 2$ into the expression: \n\n$\\sqrt{(5)^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = 11$\n\nTherefore, the positive value of the expression is $\\boxed{11}$."}
