{"question": "What is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800?", "answer": "Dividing 800 by 37 gives a quotient of 21 with a remainder of 23. In other words,  \\[\n800 = 37 \\cdot 21 + 23.\n\\]Thus $37\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{777}$ is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800.", "agents_response": "To find the largest multiple of 37 less than 800, we divide 800 by 37 and find the largest whole number less than the quotient.\n\n800 \u00f7 37 \u2248 21.62\n\nThe largest whole number less than 21.62 is 21, so the largest multiple of 37 less than 800 is 37 * 21 = 777.\n\n\\boxed{777}"}
