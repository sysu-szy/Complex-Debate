{"question": "The measures of the sides of a triangle are 7, 24 and 25. What is the area of the triangle?", "answer": "We notice that $7^2+24^2=49+576=625$. Since $7^2+24^2=25^2$, the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 are the side lengths of a right triangle with legs 7 and 24 units, and hypotenuse 25 units. Thus, we can find the area of the triangle by multiplying $1/2$ by the product of lengths of the bases to get $(1/2)(7)(24)=7\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{84}$ square units.", "agents_response": "This is a right triangle since 7^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 (Pythagorean theorem).\n\nThe area of a right triangle is given by the formula: \n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nSince the three sides of the triangle are 7, 24, and 25, the base and height of the triangle are 7 and 24 respectively.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nArea = (7 * 24) / 2\nArea = 168 / 2\nArea = 84\n\n\\boxed{Area = 84}"}
