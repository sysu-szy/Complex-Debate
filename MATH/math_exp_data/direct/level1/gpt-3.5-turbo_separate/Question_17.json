{"question": "If $(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N$, what is the value of $N$?", "answer": "We have  \\[(2^3)^{(2^3)} = (2^3)^8 = 2^{(3\\cdot 8)} = 2^{24},\\] so $N = \\boxed{24}$.", "agents_response": "To simplify the expression $(2^3)^{(2^3)}$, first calculate the exponent $2^3 = 8$. Then, calculate $8^8$, which equals $2^{3\\cdot 8} = 2^{24}$. Therefore, the value of $N$ is $\\boxed{24}$."}
