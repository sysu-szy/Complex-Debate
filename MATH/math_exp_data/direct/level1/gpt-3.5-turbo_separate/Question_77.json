{"question": "The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the smaller of the two numbers?", "answer": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$y=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)-(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25-11)=\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "Let the two numbers be x and y. We are given the following information:\n\nx + y = 25 (1)\nx - y = 11 (2)\n\nAdding equations (1) and (2) together, we get:\n\n2x = 36\nx = 18\n\nSubstitute x = 18 back into equation (1) to solve for y:\n\n18 + y = 25\ny = 7\n\nTherefore, the smaller of the two numbers is $\\boxed{7}$."}
