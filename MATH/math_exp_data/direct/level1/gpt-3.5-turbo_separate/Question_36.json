{"question": "The digits 1, 3 and 5 are each used once to form each of the possible three-digit positive integers. The three-digit integers are listed from greatest to least. Which integer is listed fifth?", "answer": "There are $3!=6$ possible three-digit integers.  So the fifth number on the list will be the second smallest.  The two smallest integers have $1$ as the hundreds digit.  The smallest is $135$; the second-smallest is $\\boxed{153}$.", "agents_response": "To find the fifth number in the list of three-digit integers formed by 1, 3, and 5, we can approach in the following way:\n\nThe possible three-digit integers using 1, 3, and 5 are: 531, 513, 351, 315, 153, 135 (ordered from greatest to least).\n\nTherefore, the fifth integer in the list is $\\boxed{153}$."}
