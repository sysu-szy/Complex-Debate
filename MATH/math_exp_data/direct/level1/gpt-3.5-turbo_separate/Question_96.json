{"question": "Compute $\\arccos (-1).$  Express your answer in radians.", "answer": "Since $\\cos \\pi = -1,$ $\\arccos (-1) = \\boxed{\\pi}.$", "agents_response": "The inverse cosine function, $\\arccos(x)$, returns the angle in the interval $[0, \\pi]$ whose cosine is equal to $x$. \n\nFor $\\arccos(-1)$, we are looking for the angle whose cosine is equal to $-1$. This means that the angle is in the second or third quadrant, where the cosine function is negative.\n\nThe cosine function is negative at $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ in the second quadrant and at $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ in the third quadrant. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$."}
