{"question": "What is the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20?", "answer": "One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\\cdot30\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\\%$ of 20 is $ 130\\cdot 20\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": "First, calculate $120\\%$ of 30:\n\n$120\\%\\text{ of }30 = 1.2 \\times 30 = 36$\n\nNext, calculate $130\\%$ of 20:\n\n$130\\%\\text{ of }20 = 1.3 \\times 20 = 26$\n\nFinally, find the positive difference between the two results:\n\n$36 - 26 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is $\\boxed{10}$."}
