{"question": "If $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers such that $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4,$ then find $|ab|.$", "answer": "We have that $|ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| = 7 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{28}.$", "agents_response": "Using the properties of absolute values of complex numbers, we know that $|ab| = |a||b|.$\n\nTherefore, $|ab| = 7\\cdot4 = 28.$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{28}.$"}
