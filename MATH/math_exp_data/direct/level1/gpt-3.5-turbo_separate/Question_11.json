{"question": "Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts and 7 baseball shirts in her closet. If she randomly selects one of these shirts, what is the probability that it will not be a baseball shirt? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$.", "agents_response": "There are a total of 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 shirts in Morgan's closet.\n\nThe probability that she will not select a baseball shirt is 1 - (number of baseball shirts / total number of shirts) = 1 - (7/12) = 5/12.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Morgan randomly selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt is \\boxed{5/12}."}
