{"question": "What is the smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$?", "answer": "To find a positive number that is both a multiple of $6$ and a multiple of $8$, we'll list out the multiples of $6$, starting with $6$, and check to see if any of them are also multiples of $8$. $6$ does not divide $8$, so it isn't a multiple of $8$. $12$ and $18$ are also not evenly divisible by $8$, so they do not work, either.  $24$ is evenly divisible by $8$ (as $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$), so $\\boxed{24}$ is the smallest positive multiple of both $6$ and $8$.", "agents_response": "To find the smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $6$ and $8$. \n\nPrime factorize $6$ and $8$:\n$6 = 2 \\cdot 3$\n$8 = 2^3$\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in the prime factorization of the numbers. Therefore, the LCM of $6$ and $8$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 = 24$. \n\nSo, the smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$ is $\\boxed{24}$."}
