{"question": "Sarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings. She has 9 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could she order?", "answer": "There are 9 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of a 9-element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${9 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{36}$ to compute this.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is given by nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of options and r is the number of options we are choosing.\n\nIn this case, n = 9 (total number of toppings) and r = 2 (number of toppings Sarah wants to choose).\n\nTherefore, the number of different pizzas Sarah could order is 9C2 = 9! / 2!(9-2)! = 36.\n\n\\boxed{36}"}
