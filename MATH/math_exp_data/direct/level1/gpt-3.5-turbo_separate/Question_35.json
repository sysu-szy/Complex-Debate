{"question": "For what value of $x$ is $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$?", "answer": "Since the prime factorization of 72 is $72=2^3\\cdot 3^2$, we have $x=\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "Given $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$, we can simplify the left side of the equation by evaluating $2^3$ to $8$. Then our equation becomes $8\\cdot3^x=72$. \n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $8$, we have: $3^x=9$.\n\nSince $3^2 = 9$, we can conclude that $x = \\boxed{2}$."}
