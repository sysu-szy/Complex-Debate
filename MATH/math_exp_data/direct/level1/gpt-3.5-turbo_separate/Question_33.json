{"question": "If $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60} = \\frac {60}B$, what is $A + B$?", "answer": "The equations allow us to solve for both $A$ and $B$. Note that $A=60 \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 24$ and $B=\\frac{60}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150$, for a total of $24+150=\\boxed{174}$.", "agents_response": "We have $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60}$, therefore $A = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 24$. \n\nWe also have $\\frac 25 = \\frac{60}{B}$, which implies $B = \\frac{60}{2/5} = 150$. \n\nThus, $A + B = 24 + 150 = \\boxed{174}$."}
