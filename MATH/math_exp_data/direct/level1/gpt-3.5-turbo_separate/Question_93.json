{"question": "Jeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?", "answer": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes.", "agents_response": "To find the time it will take Jeremiah to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour, we can use the formula: \n\ntime = distance / speed \n\nPlugging in the values, we get: \ntime = 20 miles / 60 miles per hour \n\nSimplifying, we get: \ntime = 1/3 hour \n\nConverting hours to minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): \ntime = 1/3 hour * 60 minutes per hour = 20 minutes \n\nTherefore, it will take Jeremiah \\boxed{20} minutes to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour."}
