{"question": "Zach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?", "answer": "If Zach has three or more pencils left over, then he can add another pencil to each bag.  Therefore, Zach can have at most $\\boxed{2}$ pencils left over.", "agents_response": "Let the number of pencils in each bag be represented by $x$. Since the number of pencils has to be divided equally among the three bags, the total number of pencils must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet $x = 3n$, where $n$ is the greatest integer that makes $x$ an integer. The greatest number of pencils that Zach could have left over would be when he has $3$ pencils in each bag, so $x = 3 \\times 3 = 9$. The remaining number of pencils would be $13$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is $\\boxed{13}$."}
