{"question": "How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ have?", "answer": "Note that $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = (x-1)^3$. The function can be written as  $y = \\frac{1}{(x-1)^3}$. Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the denominator is 0. In this case, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote, which occurs where $x = 1$.", "agents_response": "The vertical asymptotes of a function occur where the denominator equals 0 and the numerator does not. \n\nTo find the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to 0, we need to factor the denominator. \n\nFactoring $x^3-3x^2+3x-1$, we get $(x-1)^3$. So the denominator is $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = (x-1)^3$. \n\nTherefore, the function $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ has a vertical asymptote at $x = 1$.\n\nThe number of vertical asymptotes is $\\boxed{1}$."}
