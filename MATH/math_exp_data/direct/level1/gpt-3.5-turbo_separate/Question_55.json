{"question": "Factor $r^2+10r+25$.", "answer": "The quadratic term is the square of $r$ and the constant term is $5^2$.  The linear term is $2(r)(5)$, so we see that $r^2 + 10r+25 = \\boxed{(r+5)^2}$.", "agents_response": "To factor $r^2+10r+25$, we need to find two numbers that multiply to $25$ and add up to $10$. These numbers are $5$ and $5$.\nTherefore, we can factor $r^2+10r+25$ as $(r+5)(r+5)$, which simplifies to $(r+5)^2$.\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{(r+5)^2} is the factored form of $r^2+10r+25$."}
