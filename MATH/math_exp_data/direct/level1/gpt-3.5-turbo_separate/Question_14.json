{"question": "A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?", "answer": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$.", "agents_response": "She completes a full spin after rotating 360 degrees, so we can disregard those multiples and find the remaining rotation. \n\n2250 degrees - 6(360 degrees) = 2250 degrees - 2160 degrees = 90 degrees\n\nTherefore, the figure skater is facing east when she finishes her spin. \n\n\\boxed{east}"}
