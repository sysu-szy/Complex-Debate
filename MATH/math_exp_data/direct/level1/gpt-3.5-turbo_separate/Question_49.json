{"question": "The four-digit number $\\underline{374n}$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$.", "answer": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "To determine if a number is divisible by 18, we must first see if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. \n\nA number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is even. \nSince the units digit in the number is $n$, we can conclude that $n$ must be even in order for the number to be divisible by 2. \n\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \nThe sum of the digits in the number is $3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n$.\nFor this sum to be divisible by 9, $n$ must be 1, as 14 + 1 = 15, which is divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, the units digit $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$."}
