{"question": "How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \\ldots, 99, 100 ?$", "answer": "We subtract 24 from each member of the list to get $1,2,3,\\ldots,75,76$, so there are $\\boxed{76}$ numbers.  Note that this follows the $b - a + 1$ formula for how many numbers there are between $a$ and $b$ inclusive, as $100 - 25 + 1 = 76$.", "agents_response": "To find the number of numbers in a list with a constant difference, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and add 1. \n\nSo, $100 - 25 + 1 = 76$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{76}$ numbers in the list."}
