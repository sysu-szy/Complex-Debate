{"question": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7.$  Find the range of the function $h(x).$", "answer": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $2y - 7$ can take on any value from $2(-3) - 7 = -13$ to $2(5) - 7 = 3,$ inclusive.  Therefore, the range of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$", "agents_response": "The range of the function $h(x)$ is equal to twice the range of the function $f(x),$ minus 7. \n\nGiven that the range of $f(x)$ is $[-3,5],$ twice the range is $[-6,10],$ and then subtracting 7 gives us the final range for $h(x),$ which is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$"}
