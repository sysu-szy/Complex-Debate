{"question": "Observe that $45x^2 + 119x + 58$ can be factored as $(45x + 29)(x + 2).$  How does $45x^2 + 118x + 56$ factor?", "answer": "We can write\n\\begin{align*}\n45x^2 + 118x + 56 &= (45x^2 + 119x + 58) - (x + 2) \\\\\n&= (45x + 29)(x + 2) - (x + 2) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{(45x + 28)(x + 2)}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "To find the factored form of $45x^2 + 118x + 56,$ we notice that the constant term is 56, which can be factored as $8 \\times 7.$ \n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to $45 \\times 56 = 2520$ and add up to 118. The numbers are 70 and 36. \n\nSo, we can write $45x^2 + 118x + 56$ as $45x^2 + 70x + 48x + 56.$\n\nFactor by grouping, we get $5x(9x + 14) + 8(6x + 7).$\n\nThus, the factored form of $45x^2 + 118x + 56$ is $\\boxed{(5x + 8)(9x + 7)}.$"}
