{"question": "Compute $\\sin 180^\\circ$.", "answer": "Rotating the point $(1,0)$ by $180^\\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin gives us the point $(-1,0)$, so $\\sin 180^\\circ = \\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "We know that $\\sin 180^\\circ$ is equal to the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to $180^\\circ$. Since the point on the unit circle at $180^\\circ$ is $(-1,0)$, the y-coordinate is $\\boxed{0}$."}
