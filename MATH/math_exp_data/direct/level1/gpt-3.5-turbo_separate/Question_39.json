{"question": "Write $\\cfrac{\\cfrac{3}{8}+\\cfrac{7}{8}}{\\cfrac{4}{5}}$ as a simplified fraction.", "answer": "$\\cfrac{3}{8}+\\cfrac{7}{8}=\\cfrac{10}{8}=\\cfrac{5}{4}$. Therefore, $\\cfrac{5}{4}\\div\\cfrac{4}{5}=\\cfrac{5}{4}\\cdot\n\\cfrac{5}{4}=\\boxed{\\cfrac{25}{16}}$.", "agents_response": "We start by finding a common denominator for the two fractions in the numerator:\n$\\cfrac{3}{8} + \\cfrac{7}{8} = \\cfrac{3+7}{8} = \\cfrac{10}{8}$\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n$\\cfrac{\\cfrac{10}{8}}{\\cfrac{4}{5}}$\n\nNext, we divide by multiplying the reciprocal:\n$\\cfrac{10}{8} \\cdot \\cfrac{5}{4} = \\cfrac{10\\cdot5}{8\\cdot4} = \\cfrac{50}{32}$\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n$\\cfrac{50}{32} = \\cfrac{25}{16}$\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{\\cfrac{25}{16}}$ is the simplified fraction."}
