{"question": "John meant to divide a number by $2$, but he was careless and subtracted $2$ from the number instead.  He got an answer of $22$.  What would his answer have been had he actually divided by $2$ instead of subtracting $2$?", "answer": "Let the number John was supposed to divide by 2 be $x$. We have the equation $x-2=22$, from which we find that $x=24$. Had John divided by 2, he would have gotten $x/2=24/2=12$. Thus, the answer John should have gotten is $\\boxed{12}$.", "agents_response": "Let the number be represented by $x$.\nJohn's incorrect calculation: $x-2=22$\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=22+2=24$.\nThe correct calculation would be dividing $x$ by $2$: $\\frac{24}{2}=12$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."}
