{"question": "Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ is the same as $110\\%$ of what number?", "answer": "We have $5+\\frac{500}{100}\\cdot10=5+5\\cdot10=55$ equal to $110\\%$ of the number $x$. $$\\frac{110}{100}x=\\frac{11}{10}x=55\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=55\\cdot\\frac{10}{11}=5\\cdot10=50$$ The number is $\\boxed{50}$.", "agents_response": "Let the number we are looking for be $x$.\n$5 + 500\\% \\text{ of } 10 = 5 + 5 \\times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55$.\n$110\\% \\text{ of } x = 1.1x$.\nSetting the two equations equal to each other:\n$1.1x = 55$.\nDividing by $1.1$ to solve for $x$:\n$x = \\frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{50}$."}
