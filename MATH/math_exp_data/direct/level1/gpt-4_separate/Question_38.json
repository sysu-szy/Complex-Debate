{"question": "Zach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?", "answer": "If Zach has three or more pencils left over, then he can add another pencil to each bag.  Therefore, Zach can have at most $\\boxed{2}$ pencils left over.", "agents_response": "The greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is when he has just 2 pencils less than enough to fill another round in all three bags. As such, the most pencils he could have left over would be 2. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2}."}
