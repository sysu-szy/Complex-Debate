{"question": "Find the integer $n,$ $-90 < n < 90,$ such that $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ.$", "answer": "Since tangent function has period $180^\\circ,$\n\\[\\tan 252^\\circ = \\tan (252^\\circ - 180^\\circ) = \\tan 72^\\circ,\\]so $n = \\boxed{72}.$", "agents_response": "The tangent function has a period of 180 degrees, which means that $\\tan(n) = \\tan(n + 180k)$ for any integer $k$. Therefore, we can find an equivalent angle to 252 degrees by subtracting multiples of 180 until we get an angle between -90 and 90 degrees. \n\nSubtracting 180 from 252 gives 72 degrees, which is between -90 and 90. Hence, $n=72$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{72}.$"}
