{"question": "If $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, what is the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations?", "answer": "We wish to solve for $a$ and $b$. First, multiply the second equation by $2$ and subtract it from the first. This gives $(3a - 2a) + (2b - 2b) = (5 - 4)$, or $a = 1$. Then, plugging $a = 1$ into the second equation yields $1 + b = 2$, so $b = 1$. Thus, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations is $\\boxed{(1,1)}$.", "agents_response": "Let's start by solving second equation for $a$ and substitute it into the first one:\n$a=2-b$\n$3(2-b)+2b=5$\n$6-3b+2b=5$\n$b=1$\nNow, substitute $b=1$ into the second equation to solve for $a$:\n$a+1=2$\n$a=1$\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is $a=1$ and $b=1$.\n\\boxed{(1,1)}."}
