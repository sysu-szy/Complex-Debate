{"question": "Factor $r^2+10r+25$.", "answer": "The quadratic term is the square of $r$ and the constant term is $5^2$.  The linear term is $2(r)(5)$, so we see that $r^2 + 10r+25 = \\boxed{(r+5)^2}$.", "agents_response": "The given expression is a perfect square trinomial. It can be factored into $(r+5)^2$. So, the factored form of $r^2+10r+25$ is \\boxed{(r+5)^2}."}
