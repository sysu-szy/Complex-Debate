{"question": "Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ is the same as $110\\%$ of what number?", "answer": "We have $5+\\frac{500}{100}\\cdot10=5+5\\cdot10=55$ equal to $110\\%$ of the number $x$. $$\\frac{110}{100}x=\\frac{11}{10}x=55\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=55\\cdot\\frac{10}{11}=5\\cdot10=50$$ The number is $\\boxed{50}$.", "agents_response": "Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ is $5 + 5 \\cdot 10 = 55$.\nWe want to find a number such that $110\\%$ of it is $55$. Since $110\\%$ is the same as $1.10$, we solve the equation $1.10x = 55$.\nDividing both sides by $1.10$, we get $x = 50$. \nSo, \\boxed{50} is the solution."}
