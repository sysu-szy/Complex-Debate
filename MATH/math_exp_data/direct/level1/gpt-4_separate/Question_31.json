{"question": "Compute: $32^2 - 18^2$.", "answer": "$32^2 - 18^2$ can also be expressed as $(32+18)(32-18)$. This simplifies as $50 \\cdot 14$, which equals $\\boxed{700}$.", "agents_response": "We can simplify the expression using the difference of squares factoring formula, $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.\n\nSo,\n\n$32^2 - 18^2 = (32+18)(32-18)$\n$= 50*14$\n$= 700$\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{700}."}
