{"question": "Triangle $AXY$ is similar to triangle $ZBC$. If $AX = 6$ cm, $ZB = 18$ cm and $ZC = 63$ cm, what is the length of segment $AY$, in centimeters?", "answer": "Because they are similar, $\\frac{AX}{ZB} = \\frac{AY}{ZC}$, therefore, $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{AY}{63} \\rightarrow AY = \\boxed{21}$", "agents_response": "The triangles are similar, so their corresponding sides are proportional. \nWe can set up the following proportion to find $AY$: \n\n$\\frac{ZB}{AX} = \\frac{ZC}{AY}$\n\nSubstituting, we get: \n\n$\\frac{18 \\text{ cm}}{6 \\text{ cm}} = \\frac{63 \\text{ cm}}{AY}$\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n$18 \\cdot AY = 63 \\cdot 6$ \n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$18 \\cdot AY = 378$\n\nDividing by $18$, we find:\n\n$AY = \\frac{378}{18} = 21$ cm.\n\nThus, the length of segment $AY$ in centimeters is $\\boxed{21}$."}
