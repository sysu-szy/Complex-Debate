{"question": "What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9?", "answer": "Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $\\boxed{1}.$", "agents_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9, we first find the sum of the numbers. \nThe sum of the first 10 natural numbers is given by the formula: $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. So, the sum is $\\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \\frac{10*11}{2} = 55$ \n\nNow we need to divide 55 by 9 and find the remainder.\n\nThe quotient of 55 divided by 9 is 6, and the remainder is 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9 is \\boxed{1}."}
