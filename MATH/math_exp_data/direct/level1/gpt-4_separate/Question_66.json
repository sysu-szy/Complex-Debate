{"question": "How many integers satisfy the equation: $3n^3-12n = 0$ ?", "answer": "We factor the polynomial to get $3n(n^2-4)=0$. The product equals $0$ if $n=0$ or $n^2-4=0 \\Rightarrow n=\\pm 2$. The integers $0,2,-2$ satisfy the equation, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers.", "agents_response": "The equation can be factored as 3n(n-2)(n+2) = 0. Therefore, the integers that satisfy this equation are n=0, n=2, and n=-2. Therefore, there are \\boxed{3} integers that satisfy the equation."}
