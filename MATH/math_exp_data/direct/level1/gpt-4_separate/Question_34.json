{"question": "Compute $\\arccos \\left (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right).$  Express your answer in radians.", "answer": "Since $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$ $\\arccos \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}}.$", "agents_response": "We recognize $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ as a special value for the cosine function. Cosine takes on this value at angles $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $\\frac{7\\pi}{4}$ for angles between $0$ and $2\\pi.$ However, because $\\cos (x)$ is negative in the second and third quadrants, we choose the angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4},$ which is between $\\pi/2$ and $\\pi$, as our solution.\nSo, $\\arccos \\left (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}$."}
