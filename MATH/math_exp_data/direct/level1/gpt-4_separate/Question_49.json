{"question": "The four-digit number $\\underline{374n}$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$.", "answer": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. For a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit (in this case, n) has to be even. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. The sum of the digits in the number 374n is 3+7+4+n = 14+n.\n\nThe only even numbers that 14+n could be to make the sum a multiple of 9 are 16 and 18 which correspond to n = 2 and n = 4.\n\nHowever, the sum could also be 9, so n could be -5. But n is supposed to be the units place of a 4-digit number, so n must be a non-negative single digit number.\n\nTherefore, the only suitable value for n is \\boxed{2}."}
