{"question": "Kailin's favorite restaurant has a special offer on a three-course meal. A meal consists of an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The menu features five appetizers, eight entrees and four desserts. How many different three-course meals can be formed with these choices?", "answer": "There are 5 choices for an appetizer, 8 choices for an entree, and 4 choices for a dessert.  In total, these three independent decisions can be made in $5\\times8\\times4=\\boxed{160}$ ways.", "agents_response": "The number of different three-course meals that can be formed is the product of the number of options for each course, because choices for each course are independent of each other. So to determine the number of different meals, multiply the numbers of appetizers, entrees, and desserts together.\n\n\\boxed{5} appetizers * \\boxed{8} entrees * \\boxed{4} desserts = \\boxed{160} different meals."}
