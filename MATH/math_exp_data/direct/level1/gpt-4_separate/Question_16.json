{"question": "Observe that $45x^2 + 119x + 58$ can be factored as $(45x + 29)(x + 2).$  How does $45x^2 + 118x + 56$ factor?", "answer": "We can write\n\\begin{align*}\n45x^2 + 118x + 56 &= (45x^2 + 119x + 58) - (x + 2) \\\\\n&= (45x + 29)(x + 2) - (x + 2) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{(45x + 28)(x + 2)}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "The given factorization hints us to think about finding two numbers that multiply to $56$ and add to $118$. The two numbers are $56$ and $2$. Thus, the factorization of $45x^2 + 118x + 56$ is $(45x + 56)(x + 1)$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{(45x + 56)(x + 1)}$."}
