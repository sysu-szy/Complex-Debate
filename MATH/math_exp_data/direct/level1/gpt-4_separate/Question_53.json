{"question": "What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9?", "answer": "Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $\\boxed{1}.$", "agents_response": "The sum $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is an arithmetic series, with first term $a = 1$, last term $l = 10$, and the number of terms $n = 10$. \n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula $S_n = n/2 *(a + l)$, hence $S_{10} = 10/2 *(1 + 10) = 55$.\n\nThe remainder when $55$ is divided by $9$ is $1$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by $9$ is $\\boxed{1}$."}
