{"question": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7.$  Find the range of the function $h(x).$", "answer": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $2y - 7$ can take on any value from $2(-3) - 7 = -13$ to $2(5) - 7 = 3,$ inclusive.  Therefore, the range of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-13,3]}.$", "agents_response": "The range of $h(x)$ can be found by applying the transformation rules to the original range $[-3,5].$ Given the function $h(x) = 2f(x) - 7,$ the 2 in front of $f(x)$ will stretch the range by a factor of 2, and the $-7$ will shift the range down by 7 units. Therefore, the range of $h(x)$ is $[2(-3)-7, 2(5)-7] = [-6-7,10-7] = [-13,3].$\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{[-13,3]}."}
