{"question": "A figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?", "answer": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, remember that a complete spin (360 degrees) brings the skater back to her original position. Therefore, when the skater spins 2250 degrees, simply calculate how many complete spins she makes, and what extra rotation is left over.\n\nComplete spins are given by 2250 \u00f7 360 = 6 remainder 90. This means after spinning 6 full rotations (and ending up facing north each time), the skater still has to spin another 90 degrees to her right.\n\nA 90-degree spin to the right from the northern direction results in her facing east.\n\nTherefore, the figure skater is facing \\boxed{east} when she finishes her 2250-degree spin."}
