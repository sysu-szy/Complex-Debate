{"question": "Roslyn has ten boxes. Five of the boxes contain pencils, four of the boxes contain pens, and two of the boxes contain both pens and pencils. How many boxes contain neither pens nor pencils?", "answer": "Of the 5 boxes with pencils, 2 have pens also, so $5-2=3$ have pencils only.  Similarly, $4-2 =2$ of the boxes have pens only:\n\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Pencils\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Pens\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$2$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$3$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nThat gives us $3+2+2=7$ boxes with pens, pencils, or both.  This leaves $10-7 = \\boxed{3}$ with neither.", "agents_response": "Given that Roslyn has ten boxes, and that five boxes contain pencils, four contain pens, and two contain both, it is important to note that the two boxes that contain both pens and pencils are already included in the count of boxes with pencils and boxes with pens. This means that the total number of boxes containing pencils or pens (or both) is 5 + 4 - 2 = 7. \n\nSo, if Roslyn has ten boxes in total but seven of them contain pencils or pens, then the number of boxes that contain neither pencils nor pens is 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nSo, \\boxed{3} boxes contain neither pencil nor pen."}
