{"question": "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 4$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = -5,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$", "answer": "We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (4)(-5) = \\boxed{-20}.$", "agents_response": "The determinant of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of the determinants of the two matrices. Therefore, $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = \\det \\mathbf{A} \\times \\det \\mathbf{B} = 4 \\times (-5) = -20.$\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{-20}."}
