{"question": "Jeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?", "answer": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes.", "agents_response": "Jeremiah's car travels at 60 miles per hour, so that means it travels 1 mile every minute (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). If he needs to travel 20 miles, then it will take him 20 minutes to travel that distance, at his current speed.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{20}."}
