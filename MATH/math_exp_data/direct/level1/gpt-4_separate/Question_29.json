{"question": "While watching a parade I saw some clowns and horses. I counted 30 legs and 10 heads. How many horses did I see in the parade?", "answer": "Let the number of clowns in the parade be $c$ and the number of horses be $h$. We are looking for the value of $h$. Assuming that each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each horse has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c+4h &= 30 \\\\\nc + h &= 10 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo solve for $h$, we need to eliminate $c$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $c=10-h$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$ gives $2(10-h)+4h = 30$, or $h=5$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ horses in the parade.", "agents_response": "Let's denote clowns by C and horses by H. We know that:\n\n1. A clown has 2 legs and 1 head.\n2. A horse has 4 legs and 1 head.\n\nWe have two equations here:\n\n1. C + H = 10 (from the total number of heads)\n2. 2C + 4H = 30 (from the total number of legs).\n\nWe can simplify the second equation to C + 2H = 15.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the simplified second equation, we get H = 5.\n\nSo, I saw 5 horses in the parade.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{5}."}
