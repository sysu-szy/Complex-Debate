{"question": "If $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60} = \\frac {60}B$, what is $A + B$?", "answer": "The equations allow us to solve for both $A$ and $B$. Note that $A=60 \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 24$ and $B=\\frac{60}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150$, for a total of $24+150=\\boxed{174}$.", "agents_response": "First, we find $A$. Since $\\frac 25 = \\frac A{60}$, we multiply these two values to find $A$, getting $\\frac{2*60} {5}$, or $24$.\n\nNext, to find $B$, we can identify that $\\frac 25 = \\frac {60}B$, and solve this equation for $B$. In other words, we multiply both sides by $B$ to remove it from the denominator on the right, and divide both sides by $\\frac 25$ to solve for $B$. Doing this gives us $B = \\frac{60}{2/5}$, which simplifies to $150$.\n\nFinally, we add $A$ and $B$ to get $24 + 150$ or $174$. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{174}."}
