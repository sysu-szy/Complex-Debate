{"question": "What is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800?", "answer": "Dividing 800 by 37 gives a quotient of 21 with a remainder of 23. In other words,  \\[\n800 = 37 \\cdot 21 + 23.\n\\]Thus $37\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{777}$ is the largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800.", "agents_response": "The largest multiple of 37 which is less than 800 is 777. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{777}."}
