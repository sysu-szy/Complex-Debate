{"question": "An amusement park charges an entry fee of $\\$2.25$ plus $\\$1.50$ for each ride. If Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, how many rides did he pay for?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of rides for which Simon paid. Then $12.75=2.25+1.50x\\implies 1.50x=10.50\\implies x=\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "Simon spent a total of $12.75 - 2.25 = \\$10.50$ on rides. Since each ride costs $\\$1.50$, he therefore rode $10.50 \\div 1.5 = 7$ rides. So the answer is \\boxed{7}."}
