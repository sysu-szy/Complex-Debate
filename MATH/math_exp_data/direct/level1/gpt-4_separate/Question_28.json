{"question": "How many numbers are in the list $ 36, 37, 38, \\ldots, 92, 93 ?$", "answer": "We subtract 35 from each member of the list to get $1,2,3,\\ldots,57,58$, so there are $\\boxed{58}$ numbers.", "agents_response": "The problem is asking for the count of consecutive numbers in a list. This can be calculated by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number in the list, and then adding 1. \n\nSo, the number of numbers in the list is $ 93 - 36 + 1 = \\boxed{58}$."}
