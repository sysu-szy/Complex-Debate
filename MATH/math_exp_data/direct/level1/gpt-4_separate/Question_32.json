{"question": "In the diagram, what is the value of $x?$ [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,5)--(0,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,5));\ndraw((0,.3)--(.3,.3)--(.3,0));\nlabel(\"$2x^\\circ$\",(.5,2));\nlabel(\"$3x^\\circ$\",(1,.6));\n[/asy]", "answer": "The angles $2x^{\\circ}$ and $3x^{\\circ}$ shown are complementary and thus add to $90^{\\circ}.$ Therefore, $2x+3x=90$ or $5x=90$ and so $x=\\frac{90}{5}=\\boxed{18}.$", "agents_response": "The problem is solved by the following principles: a triangle's angles sum to $180^\\circ$ and a right angle equals $90^\\circ$.\n\nThe triangle has one angle of $90^{\\circ}$, one of $2x^{\\circ}$, and one of $3x^{\\circ}$. This means you can set up the equation $2x + 3x + 90 = 180$, which sums up the angles in the triangle. Solving for $x$ gives us:\n\n$5x +90 = 180$\n\n$5x = 90$\n\n$x = 18$\n\nSo our final answer is $\\boxed{18}$."}
