{"question": "John meant to divide a number by $2$, but he was careless and subtracted $2$ from the number instead.  He got an answer of $22$.  What would his answer have been had he actually divided by $2$ instead of subtracting $2$?", "answer": "Let the number John was supposed to divide by 2 be $x$. We have the equation $x-2=22$, from which we find that $x=24$. Had John divided by 2, he would have gotten $x/2=24/2=12$. Thus, the answer John should have gotten is $\\boxed{12}$.", "agents_response": "Since John subtracted $2$ from the number and got $22$, the original number was $22+2=24$. If he had divided $24$ by $2$, he would have gotten $24/2=12$. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{12}."}
