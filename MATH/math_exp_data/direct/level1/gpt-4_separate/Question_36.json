{"question": "The digits 1, 3 and 5 are each used once to form each of the possible three-digit positive integers. The three-digit integers are listed from greatest to least. Which integer is listed fifth?", "answer": "There are $3!=6$ possible three-digit integers.  So the fifth number on the list will be the second smallest.  The two smallest integers have $1$ as the hundreds digit.  The smallest is $135$; the second-smallest is $\\boxed{153}$.", "agents_response": "The six three-digit integers that can be formed by using the digits 1, 3, and 5 each once are 135, 153, 315, 351, 513, and 531, listed here in ascending order. When these integers are listed from greatest to least, we have the list 531, 513, 351, 315, 153, and 135. The fifth integer in this list is \\boxed{153}."}
