{"question": "Let $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ be the roots of\n\\[2x^4 - 8x^3 + 7 = 0.\\]Find $a + b + c + d.$", "answer": "By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = \\frac{8}{2} = \\boxed{4}.$", "agents_response": "The sum of the roots of a polynomial equation is given by $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the term 1 degree lower than the largest degree term (here 4 degree term is the largest), and $a$ is the coefficient of the term of the largest degree.\nHere, the sum the roots $a + b + c + d = -(-8/2) = \\boxed{4}$."}
