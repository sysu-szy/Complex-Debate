{"question": "How many integers are there on the number line between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$?", "answer": "Because 17 is between $5\\times3=15$ and $6\\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\\times9=288$ and $33\\times9=297$ and thus that $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\\boxed{27}$ integers.", "agents_response": "The range of integers we need to find is between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$. First, simplify these values.\n\n$\\dfrac{17}{3} \\approx 5.67$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{289}{9} \\approx 32.11$\n\nThe integers on the number line between these two values are the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive. Count these values to get 27. \n\nSo, \\boxed{27}."}
