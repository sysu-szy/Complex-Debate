{"question": "What is the positive value of the expression $\\sqrt{x^3 - 2^y}$ when $x = 5$ and $y = 2$?", "answer": "Plugging in, the desired expression is just $\\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{125 - 4} = \\sqrt{121} = \\boxed{11}$.", "agents_response": "When you input the values of x and y into the expression, you get $\\sqrt{5^3 - 2^2}$ which simplifies to $\\sqrt{125-4}$. This further simplifies to $\\sqrt{121}$, which gives you a straight answer of 11. Hence, your final answer is \\boxed{11}."}
