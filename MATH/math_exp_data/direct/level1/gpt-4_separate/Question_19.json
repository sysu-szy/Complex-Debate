{"question": "If $(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N$, what is the value of $N$?", "answer": "We have  \\[(2^3)^{(2^3)} = (2^3)^8 = 2^{(3\\cdot 8)} = 2^{24},\\] so $N = \\boxed{24}$.", "agents_response": "We know that $(a^{b})^{c} = a^{bc}$. \n\nApplying this, we get that $(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^{(3*2^3)}$. We simplify this to get $2^{24}$. \n\nTherefore, in the expression $2^N$, N is equal to 24. \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{24}."}
