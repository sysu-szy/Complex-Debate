{"question": "How many numbers are in the list $25, 26, 27, \\ldots, 99, 100 ?$", "answer": "We subtract 24 from each member of the list to get $1,2,3,\\ldots,75,76$, so there are $\\boxed{76}$ numbers.  Note that this follows the $b - a + 1$ formula for how many numbers there are between $a$ and $b$ inclusive, as $100 - 25 + 1 = 76$.", "agents_response": "The numbers in the list form an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 25, the last term (l) is 100, and the common difference (d) is 1.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is $a + (n - 1)  d$. We can use this forumla to find the number of terms (n):\n\n100 = 25 + (n - 1) * 1\n100 - 25 = n - 1\n75 = n - 1\nn = 76\n\nSo there are 76 numbers in the list $25, 26, 27, ..., 99, 100$.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{76}."}
