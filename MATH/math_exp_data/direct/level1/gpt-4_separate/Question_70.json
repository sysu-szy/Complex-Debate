{"question": "In the diagram, what is the value of $x?$ [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,5)--(0,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,5));\ndraw((0,.3)--(.3,.3)--(.3,0));\nlabel(\"$2x^\\circ$\",(.5,2));\nlabel(\"$3x^\\circ$\",(1,.6));\n[/asy]", "answer": "The angles $2x^{\\circ}$ and $3x^{\\circ}$ shown are complementary and thus add to $90^{\\circ}.$ Therefore, $2x+3x=90$ or $5x=90$ and so $x=\\frac{90}{5}=\\boxed{18}.$", "agents_response": "The diagram displays a right triangle. In any such triangle, the sum of the three angles is $180^\\circ$. The two angles labeled can thus be expressed as $2x^\\circ$ and $3x^\\circ$. Since the missing angle is a right angle and equals $90^\\circ$, we have the equation $2x+3x+90=180$ to solve for $x$. Solving this equation gives us $5x=90$, and so $x=\\frac{90}{5}$. Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{18}$."}
