{"question": "The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the smaller of the two numbers?", "answer": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$y=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)-(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25-11)=\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "Let's represent the two numbers as x and y, where x>y.\nWe know from the problem that:\n\nx + y = 25 (Equation 1)\nx - y = 11 (Equation 2)\n\nBy adding these two equations, we can eliminate y:\n\n2x = 36\nx = 18\n\nSubstitute x=18 in Equation 1:\n\n18 + y = 25\ny = 25 - 18\ny = 7\n\nTherefore, the smaller number is 7.\n\n\\boxed{7}"}
