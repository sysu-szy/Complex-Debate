{"question": "How many integers between 200 and 300 are perfect squares?", "answer": "Let $m$ be a positive integer. $200\\le m^2\\le300\\Rightarrow 15\\le m\\le17$. Therefore, exactly $\\boxed{3}$ integers ($15^2$, $16^2$, and $17^2$) are perfect squares between 200 and 300.", "agents_response": "A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. So we need to find the integers from 200 to 300 which are squares. \n\nThe square root of 200 is approximately 14.14 and the square root of 300 is approximately 17.32. This means the perfect squares we are looking for are the squares of the integers between 15 and 17. \n\nThose integers are 15, 16, and 17. The squares of these integers are 225, 256, and 289 respectively. So, there are 3 integers between 200 and 300 that are perfect squares. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{3}."}
