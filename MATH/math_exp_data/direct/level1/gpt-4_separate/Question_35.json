{"question": "For what value of $x$ is $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$?", "answer": "Since the prime factorization of 72 is $72=2^3\\cdot 3^2$, we have $x=\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "We start solving the problem by simplifying the equation. $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$ becomes $8\\cdot3^x=72$. Dividing both sides by 8 gives $3^x=9$. Applying the rules of logarithms on both sides (log base 3), $x = log_3(9)$ which is equal to $2$. \n\nSo, the solution is \\boxed{2}."}
