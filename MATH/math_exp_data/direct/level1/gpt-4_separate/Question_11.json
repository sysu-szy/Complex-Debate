{"question": "Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts and 7 baseball shirts in her closet. If she randomly selects one of these shirts, what is the probability that it will not be a baseball shirt? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$.", "agents_response": "Morgan has 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 shirts in total. \n\nThe probability that a shirt selected at random will not be a baseball shirt is given by the number of non-baseball shirts divided by the total number of shirts. \n\nThere are 3 hockey shirts and 2 football shirts, for a total of 3 + 2 = 5 non-baseball shirts.\n\nThe probability of selecting a non-baseball shirt, therefore, is 5 out of 12, or \\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}."}
