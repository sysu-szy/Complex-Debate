{"question": "How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ have?", "answer": "Note that $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = (x-1)^3$. The function can be written as  $y = \\frac{1}{(x-1)^3}$. Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the denominator is 0. In this case, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote, which occurs where $x = 1$.", "agents_response": "The graph of the function $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ will have a vertical asymptote wherever the denominator $x^3-3x^2+3x-1=0$. \n\nThis expression can be factored as follows:\n$x^3-3x^2+3x-1=0$\n$(x-1)^3=0$\n$x-1=0$\n\nSo there is 1 solution for $x$, namely $x=1$. Therefore, the function has \\boxed{1} vertical asymptote."}
