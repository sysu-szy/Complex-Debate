{"question": "Let's call a prime number a $\\textit{reversible prime}$ if the number formed by reversing its digits is also prime. What is the smallest reversible prime greater than 17?", "answer": "To find the smallest reversible prime greater than 17, we first consider the two-digit primes greater than 17. 19 is prime, but $91=7\\times13$ is not.\n\nWe skip all of the two-digit primes whose tens digit is 2 since the number formed by reversing the digits will be even and hence not prime.\n\nNext try the prime 31, and since 13 is prime as well, the smallest reversible prime greater than 17 is $\\boxed{31}$.", "agents_response": "The next prime number after 17 is 19. The reverse of 19 is 91 which is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. The next prime number is 23. The reverse of 23 is 32 that is not prime. The next prime number is 29. The reverse of 29 is 92, which is not prime. The next prime is 31. The reverse of 31 is 13, which is also a prime. So, the smallest reversible prime greater than 17 is 31. So, the answer is \\boxed{31}."}
