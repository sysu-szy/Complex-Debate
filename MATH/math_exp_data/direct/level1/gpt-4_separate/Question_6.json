{"question": "If $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers such that $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4,$ then find $|ab|.$", "answer": "We have that $|ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| = 7 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{28}.$", "agents_response": "The product of the absolute values (or moduli) of two complex numbers is equal to the absolute value of their product, i.e., $|ab|=|a||b|$. Thus if $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4,$ then $|ab|=7*4 = 28$.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{28}."}
