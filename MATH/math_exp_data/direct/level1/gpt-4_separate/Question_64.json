{"question": "What is the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20?", "answer": "One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\\cdot30\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\\%$ of 20 is $ 130\\cdot 20\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": "The positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is found by first calculating each percentage:\n\n- $120\\%$ of 30 is $0.2 * 30 + 30 = 6 + 30 = 36$\n- $130\\%$ of 20 is $0.3 * 20 + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26$\n\nThen, to find the positive difference, find the absolute difference between these two values:\n\n- $|36 - 26| = 10$\n\nSo, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is \\boxed{10}."}
