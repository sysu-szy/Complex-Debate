{"question": "What is the value of $\\displaystyle{(2^3)}^{\\frac{4}{3}}$?", "answer": "We have $(2^3)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = 2^{3\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}} = 2^4 = \\boxed{16}$.", "agents_response": "$\\displaystyle{(2^3)}^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ can be simplified by multiplying the exponents. This would give you $2^{(3*\\frac{4}{3})}$ which simplifies to $2^4$. \nSo, $\\displaystyle{(2^3)}^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ = $2^4$ = 16.\nTherefore, \\boxed{16}."}
