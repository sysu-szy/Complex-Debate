{"question": "What is the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!?", "answer": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$.", "agents_response": "The greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15! is 5! since 5! is a factor of all three numbers.\nSo, \\boxed{5!} = \\boxed{120} is the answer."}
