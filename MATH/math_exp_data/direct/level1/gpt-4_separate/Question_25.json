{"question": "Determine the modulo 4 remainder of the following sum: $$ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12. $$", "answer": "Grouping residues helps make some series computations easier:  \\begin{align*}\n1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2& + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0\\\\&\\equiv 3(1 + 2 + 3 + 0) \\\\\n&\\equiv 18\\\\\n& \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{4}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "To find the modulo 4 remainder, we can simplify each term in the sum by finding its remainder when divided by 4 and then sum those remainders.\n\nThe modulo 4 remainders of the numbers 1-12 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0\n\nWhen adding these up, we get 24. But, since we're looking for the modulo 4 remainder, we divide 24 by 4 to find the remainder. In this case, the remainder is 0.\n\nSo, the output is \\boxed{0}."}
