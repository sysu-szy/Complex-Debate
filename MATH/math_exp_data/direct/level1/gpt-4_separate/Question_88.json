{"question": "If $\\sqrt{400}=\\sqrt{81}+\\sqrt{n}$, then what is the value of $n$?", "answer": "Not to be fooled by the square roots, we rewrite the equation as $20=9+\\sqrt{n}.$ Thus, $\\sqrt{n}=11$ and $n=\\boxed{121}.$", "agents_response": "We first simplify $\\sqrt{400}$ and $\\sqrt{81}$ to get $20=9+\\sqrt{n}$. Solving this equation for $n$ gives us $n=(20-9)^2=11^2=121$. \n\nSo the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{121}$."}
