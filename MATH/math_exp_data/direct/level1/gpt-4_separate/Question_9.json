{"question": "Find the integer $n,$ $-90 < n < 90,$ such that $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ.$", "answer": "Since tangent function has period $180^\\circ,$\n\\[\\tan 252^\\circ = \\tan (252^\\circ - 180^\\circ) = \\tan 72^\\circ,\\]so $n = \\boxed{72}.$", "agents_response": "We know that the tangent function has period $180$ degrees, so $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ$ if and only if $n$ and $252$ differ by a multiple of $180$ degrees. The only integer $n$ in the interval $-90 < n < 90$ that differs from $252$ by a multiple of $180$ is $252 - 180 = \\boxed{72}.$"}
