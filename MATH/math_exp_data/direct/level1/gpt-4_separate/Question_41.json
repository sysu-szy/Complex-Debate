{"question": "Suppose that $4^a = 5$, $5^b = 6$, $6^c = 7$, and $7^d = 8$. What is $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d$?", "answer": "We have that\n\\[4^{ab} = 5^b = 6.\\]Then\n\\[4^{abc} = 6^c = 7,\\]and\n\\[4^{abcd} = 7^d = 8.\\]Then $2^{2abcd} = 2^3,$ so $abcd = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$", "agents_response": "First, take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation to express each in exponential form. \nThe equations become:\n$\\ln(4^a) = \\ln(5)$,\n$\\ln(5^b) = \\ln(6)$,\n$\\ln(6^c) = \\ln(7)$, and\n$\\ln(7^d) = \\ln(8)$.\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that allows moving the exponent to the front as a multiplier, the equations become:\n$a\\ln(4) = \\ln(5)$,\n$b\\ln(5) = \\ln(6)$,\n$c\\ln(6) = \\ln(7)$, and\n$d\\ln(7) = \\ln(8)$.\n\nWe want to find the product of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, so we multiply all of these expressions together. Using the property of logarithms that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\ln(5)+\\ln(6)+\\ln(7)+\\ln(8) = \\ln(5\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8)$.\n\nSolving each part of the equation, $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{\\ln(5\\cdot 6\\cdot7\\cdot8)}{\\ln(4)\\cdot\\ln(5)\\cdot\\ln(6)\\cdot\\ln(7)}$.\nWe simplify the values in the right side, we have:\n\n$a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{\\ln(2^{11})}{\\ln(2^2)\\cdot\\ln(5)\\cdot\\ln(2\\cdot3)\\cdot\\ln(7)}$.\n\nDividing by logarithms of the same base is the same as the logarithm of the quotient, so:\n\n$ a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{11}{2}$.\n\nThe answer is $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$."}
