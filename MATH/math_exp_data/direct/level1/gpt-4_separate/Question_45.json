{"question": "Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ is the same as $110\\%$ of what number?", "answer": "We have $5+\\frac{500}{100}\\cdot10=5+5\\cdot10=55$ equal to $110\\%$ of the number $x$. $$\\frac{110}{100}x=\\frac{11}{10}x=55\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=55\\cdot\\frac{10}{11}=5\\cdot10=50$$ The number is $\\boxed{50}$.", "agents_response": "Five plus $500\\%$ of $10$ simplifies to $5 + 5*10 = 55$.\n\nNow we solve the equation $110\\%$ of $X = 55$. This can be written as $1.1*X = 55$.\n\nThus, $X = 55/1.1 = 50$.\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{50} is the answer."}
