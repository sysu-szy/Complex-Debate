{"question": "If $(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N$, what is the value of $N$?", "answer": "We have  \\[(2^3)^{(2^3)} = (2^3)^8 = 2^{(3\\cdot 8)} = 2^{24},\\] so $N = \\boxed{24}$.", "agents_response": "First, let's understand the order of operations in the problem $(2^3)^{(2^3)} = 2^N$. We do the calculation inside the parentheses first. So $(2^3)$ simplifies to 8. Now our equation reads $8^{(2^3)} = 2^N$. We can again simplify $(2^3)$  to 8, so our equation is now $8^8 = 2^N$. \n\nLet's write 8 as a power of 2 for easy comparison. 8 can be written as $2^3$, so our equation changes to $(2^3)^8 = 2^N$. \n\nIn simplifying powers of powers, we multiply the exponents. So, our equation simplifies to $2^{3*8} = 2^N$. By simple multiplication, 3*8 equals 24. So our equation now reads $2^{24} = 2^N$. \n\nTherefore, our solution is $N = 24$.\n\nThe final solution to the problem is \\boxed{24}."}
