{"question": "When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7?", "answer": "Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, so $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 25 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{7}$.", "agents_response": "If Rachel's favorite number is n, we know that n = 7k + 5 for some integer k. Multiplying n by 5 gives 5n = 35k + 25.\n\nThen, dividing 5n by 7 gives a remainder of 25 \u00f7 7, which is 4 remainder 4, or simply 4.\n\nTherefore, when Rachel multiples her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7, the remainder is \\boxed{4}."}
