{"question": "Sarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings. She has 9 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could she order?", "answer": "There are 9 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of a 9-element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${9 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{36}$ to compute this.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the combination formula which is given by:\n\nC(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]\n\nWhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo the total number of different pizzas Sarah can order is given by:\n\nC(9,2) = 9! / [2!(9-2)!] = 36\n\nSo Sarah can order \\boxed{36} different pizzas."}
