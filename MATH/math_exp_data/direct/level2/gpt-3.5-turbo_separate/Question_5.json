{"question": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word GAMMAS.", "answer": "There are two A's, two M's, and six total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{180}$.", "agents_response": "The word \"GAMMAS\" has 6 letters total, with 2 A's and  2 M's. To find the number of ways to arrange these letters, we can first calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 6 letters, then divide by the ways to rearrange the A's and M's.\n\nTotal arrangements = 6!/(2!2!) = 720/(2*2) = 180\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word GAMMAS is \\boxed{180}."}
