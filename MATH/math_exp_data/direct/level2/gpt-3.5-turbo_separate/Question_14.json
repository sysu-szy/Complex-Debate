{"question": "Given that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, what is the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$?", "answer": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the given number $591{,}3d8$ is $5 + 9 + 1 + 3 + d + 8 = 26 + d$. For the sum to be divisible by 3, $d$ must be 1 (to get a sum of 27) or 4 (to get a sum of 30).\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits must form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of $591{,}3d8$ are $d8$, so $d8$ must be divisible by 4. Therefore, $d$ can be 1 or 4.\n\nThe sum of all the possible digits that could replace $d$ is $1 + 4 = \\boxed{5}$."}
