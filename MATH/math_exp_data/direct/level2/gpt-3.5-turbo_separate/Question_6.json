{"question": "What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$?", "answer": "We can write $\\frac{123}{999}$ as $0.\\overline{123}$. To see why, let $x=0.\\overline{123}$, and subtract $x$ from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 123&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 123 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{123} = \\frac{123}{999}$.\n\nThis decimal repeats every 3 digits. Since $123{,}999$ is divisible by $3$ (as the sum of the digits of $123{,}999$ is equal to $33$), it follows that $123{,}999^{\\rm th}$ digit after the decimal point is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, namely $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "To find the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$, we first simplify the fraction to $\\frac{41}{333}$. To express this as a decimal, we perform long division:\n\n$333 \\, \\big|\\, 41.000$\n\n$-333$\n\n$\\underline{ \\hspace{1cm} -0.000}$ \n\n$ 770$\n\n$-666$\n\n$\\underline{\\hspace{.3cm} 1040}$ \n\n$999$\n\n$\\underline{\\hspace{3.6cm} 410}$\n\n$333$\n\n$\\underline{\\hspace{4.6cm} 770}$\n\nTherefore, the decimal expansion of $\\frac{41}{333}$ is $0.123123123\\ldots$\n\nSince the decimal expansion repeats after three digits, we find the remainder when dividing 123,999 by 3 to determine which digit corresponds to the 123,999th digit after the decimal point. The remainder is 0.\n\nThus, the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$ is $\\boxed{1}$."}
