{"question": "Four-digit integers are formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Any of the digits can be used any number of times. How many such four-digit integers are palindromes? Palindromes read the same forward and backward.", "answer": "If the four-digit integer is to be a palindrome, then the third digit must be the same as the second and the fourth must be the same as the first.  So, once we choose the first two digits, we can only form the palindrome in one way. There are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, so there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ such integers.", "agents_response": "To form a four-digit palindrome using the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can split into two cases: \n\nCase 1: The palindrome is in the form of AABB\nSince the number is a palindrome, the digits A and B must be the same.\nThe possible choices for A and B are 2, 3, 4, or 5. So there are 4 choices.\nTherefore, there are 4 such palindromes.\n\nCase 2: The palindrome is in the form of ABBA\nThe possible choices for A and B are again 2, 3, 4, or 5. So there are 4 choices for A and 4 choices for B.\nTherefore, there are 4 * 4 = 16 such palindromes.\n\nCombining the two cases, there are 4 (from Case 1) + 16 (from Case 2) = 20 four-digit integers that are palindromes. \n\nTherefore, \\boxed{20} is the final answer."}
