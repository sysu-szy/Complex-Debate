{"question": "On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs?", "answer": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $\\boxed{63}$ ligs are equivalent.", "agents_response": "First, we need to find the relationship between ligs and lugs. \n\nFrom the given information:\n7 ligs = 4 lags\n9 lags = 20 lugs\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between ligs and lugs. Let's first find the relationship between lags and lugs:\n9 lags = 20 lugs\n1 lags = 20/9 lugs\n\nNow, let's find the relationship between ligs and lags:\n7 ligs = 4 lags\n1 ligs = 4/7 lags\n\nFinally, we can find the relationship between ligs and lugs:\n1 ligs = (4/7) lags\n1 ligs = (4/7) * (20/9) lugs\n1 ligs = 80/63 lugs\n\nNow that we know that 1 ligs = 80/63 lugs, we can find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs:\n80 * (63/80) = \\boxed{63} ligs"}
