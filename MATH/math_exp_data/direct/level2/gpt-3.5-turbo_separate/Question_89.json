{"question": "What is the largest integer less than 1000 which is divisible by 11?", "answer": "We find that 1000 gives a quotient of 90 and a remainder of 10 when divided by 11. Therefore, if we subtract 10 from 1000 we should subtract 10 from the remainder as well, which gives us zero. This means that $1000-10 = \\boxed{990}$ is divisible by 11, while the next number divisible by 11 is $990+11 = 1001.$", "agents_response": "To find the largest integer less than 1000 divisible by 11, we need to divide 1000 by 11 and find the largest whole number less than the result.\n\n1000 \u00f7 11 = 90 with a remainder of 10\n\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 1000 which is divisible by 11 is 11 * 90 = \\boxed{990}."}
