{"question": "A movie theater seats $100$ patrons. The theater is full for the 5:00 pm Saturday movie. Adult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each and children's tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each. If the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show, how many children's tickets were sold?", "answer": "We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.", "agents_response": "Let $a$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $c$ be the number of children's tickets sold. We can set up the following system of equations using the given information:\n$a + c = 100$\n$9a + 5c = 640$\nSolving the system, we get $a = 40$ and $c = 60$. Therefore, $\\boxed{60}$ children's tickets were sold."}
