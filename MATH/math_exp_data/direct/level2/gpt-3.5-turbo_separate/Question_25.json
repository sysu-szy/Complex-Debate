{"question": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then what remainder does $2n+1$ give when divided by 7?", "answer": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "Let's first find out what values $n$ can take when divided by 7 with a remainder of 3. We can express this as $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNow we need to find $2n + 1$:\n$2n + 1 = 2(7k + 3) + 1$\n$= 14k + 6 + 1$\n$= 14k + 7$\n$= 7(2k + 1)$\n\nSince $2k + 1$ is an integer, when $2n + 1$ is divided by 7, the remainder will be $\\boxed{0}$."}
