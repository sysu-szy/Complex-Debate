{"question": "What is the smallest positive integer solution to $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$?", "answer": "The fraction's numerator is equal to $10^8$, or $100^4$.  Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find that $\\frac{100}{x} < 1$, meaning that $100<x$ (since $x$ is positive).  So $x = \\boxed{101}$ is the smallest positive integer solution.", "agents_response": "We can rewrite the inequality as $x^4 > 100,000,000$. Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get $x > \\sqrt[4]{100,000,000} = \\sqrt[4]{10^8} = 100$. Since $100$ is not a solution to the inequality, the smallest positive integer solution is $101$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{101}."}
