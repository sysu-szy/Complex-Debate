{"question": "February $1$, $2008$ is a Friday.  The last Friday of February $2008$ will be February $x$, $2008$.  If $2008$ is a leap year, what is the value of $x$?", "answer": "If 2008 is a leap year, that means there are 29 days in February, and February 29 is $28=7\\cdot4$ days after February 1, so it is also a Friday. Thus, $x=\\boxed{29}$.", "agents_response": "February $2008$ has $29$ days because it is a leap year. Since February $1$, $2008$ is a Friday, every $7$ days from that date will also fall on a Friday. \n\nCounting $7$ days at a time, we find that the last Friday of February $2008$ will fall on February $29$, $2008$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{29}$."}
