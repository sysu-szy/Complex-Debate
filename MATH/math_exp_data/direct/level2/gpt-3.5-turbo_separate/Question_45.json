{"question": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE.", "answer": "First we count the arrangements if the two N's are unique, which is 4!. Then since the N's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ for the arrangements of the N's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2!} = \\boxed{12}$.", "agents_response": "The word NINE has 4 letters, with 2 of them being repeated (the two Es). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters can be found using the formula for permutations with indistinguishable objects, which is n! / (n1! * n2! * ...), where n is the total number of objects and n1, n2, etc. represent the number of indistinguishable objects in each group.\n\nFor the word NINE, we have:\nn = 4 (total number of letters)\nn1 = 2 (number of Es)\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE is 4! / (2!) = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\n\\boxed{12} is the final answer."}
