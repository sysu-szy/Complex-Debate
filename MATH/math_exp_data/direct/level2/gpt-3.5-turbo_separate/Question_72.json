{"question": "The temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?", "answer": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "Since the temperature rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes, the rate of increase is $1.5/15 = 0.1$ degrees per minute. \n\nIn $2$ hours, there are $2 \\times 60 = 120$ minutes. \n\nTherefore, the temperature will rise by $0.1 \\times 120 = \\boxed{12}$ degrees."}
