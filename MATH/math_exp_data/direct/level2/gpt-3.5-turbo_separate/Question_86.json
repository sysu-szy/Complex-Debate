{"question": "The solution to $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$ is expressed in the form $a < x < b$. Find the value of $a + b$.", "answer": "Since everything in sight is even, we should begin by dividing by 2.  That gives \\[-2<x-1<4.\\] To isolate $x$, we add 1, so \\[-1<x<5.\\] Since $a=-1$ and $b=5$, we get $a+b=-1+5=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "To solve $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$:\n1. Divide all parts by 2: $-2 < x - 1 < 4$\n2. Add 1 to all parts: $-1 < x < 5$\n\nTherefore, $a = -1$ and $b = 5$, so $a + b = -1 + 5 = 4$.\n\n$\\boxed{4}$"}
