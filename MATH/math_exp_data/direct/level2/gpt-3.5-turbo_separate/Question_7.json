{"question": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "answer": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the distance between two complex numbers $z_1 = a+bi$ and $z_2 = c+di$, we use the formula:\n\n$$|z_2 - z_1| = |(c+di) - (a+bi)|$$\n$$= |c-a + (d-b)i|$$\n$$= \\sqrt{(c-a)^2 + (d-b)^2}$$\n\nSo in this case, $z_1 = 5+6i$ and $z_2 = -2+2i$, giving us:\n\n$$|(-2+2i) - (5+6i)| = \\sqrt{(-2-5)^2 + (2-6)^2}$$\n$$= \\sqrt{(-7)^2 + (-4)^2}$$\n$$= \\sqrt{49 + 16}$$\n$$= \\sqrt{65}$$\n\nTherefore, the distance between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$ in the complex plane is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$."}
