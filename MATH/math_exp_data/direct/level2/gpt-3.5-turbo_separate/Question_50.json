{"question": "Find the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$.", "answer": "$9 \\cdot 9 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 81 + 1 = 82$, so the units digit is $\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "To find the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$, we can first find the units digit of each product separately:\n- The units digit of $29 \\cdot 79$ is the same as the units digit of $9 \\cdot 9$ which is $1$.\n- The units digit of $31 \\cdot 81$ is the same as the units digit of $1 \\cdot 1$ which is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$ is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n\\boxed{2}"}
