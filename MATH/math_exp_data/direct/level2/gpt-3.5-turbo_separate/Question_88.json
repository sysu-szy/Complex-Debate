The radius of the base is $3$ cm, so we have $9\\pi h=45\\pi\\qquad\\Rightarrow h=5$. The height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{5}$ cm.", "agents_response": "The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. Given that the volume is $45\\pi$ cubic cm and the radius is 3 cm, we can plug in the values and solve for $h$:\n\n$45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h$\n\n$45 = 9h$\n\n$h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5$\n\nTherefore, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{5}$ cm."}
