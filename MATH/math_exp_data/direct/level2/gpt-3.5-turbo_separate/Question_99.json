{"question": "Find all values of $x,$ $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\pi,$ which satisfy\n\\[\\sin^2 x + \\cos x + 1 = 0.\\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.", "answer": "Since $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x,$ we get\n\\[1 - \\cos^2 x + \\cos x + 1 = 0.\\]Then $\\cos^2 x - \\cos x - 2 = 0,$ which factors as $(\\cos x - 2)(\\cos x + 1) = 0.$  Since $-1 \\le \\cos x \\le 1,$ the only possible value of $\\cos x = -1.$  The only solution in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\pi$ is $x = \\boxed{\\pi}.$", "agents_response": "We can rewrite the equation as $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x + \\cos x = 0.$\nUsing the Pythagorean identity, $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1,$ we get $1 + \\cos x = 0,$ which means $\\cos x = -1.$\nThe only value of $x$ between $0$ and $2\\pi$ that satisfies this is $x = \\pi.$\nTherefore, the solution is $\\boxed{\\pi}.$"}
