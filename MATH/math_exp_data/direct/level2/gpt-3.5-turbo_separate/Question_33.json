{"question": "Find the sum of all solutions of the equation $|2-x|= 3$.", "answer": "In order to have $|2-x| = 3$, we must have $2-x = 3$ or $2-x = -3$.  If $2-x = 3$, then $x=-1$, and if $2-x = -3$, then $x = 5$.  The sum of these solutions is $(-1) + 5 = \\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "The absolute value equation $|2-x|=3$ has two cases:\nCase 1: $2-x=3$, then $x=-1$.\nCase 2: $2-x=-3$, then $x=5$.\n\nThe sum of the solutions $(-1 + 5)$ is $\\boxed{4}$."}
