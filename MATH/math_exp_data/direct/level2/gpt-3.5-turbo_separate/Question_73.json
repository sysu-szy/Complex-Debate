{"question": "Let $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the degree measures of the five angles of a pentagon.  Suppose $v<w<x<y<z$ and $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ form an arithmetic sequence. Find the value of $x$.", "answer": "A pentagon can be partitioned into three triangles, so the sum of the degree measures of the angles of the pentagon is $$\nv+w+x+y+z=540.\n$$The arithmetic sequence can be expressed as $x-2d$, $x-d$, $x$, $x+d$, and $x+2d$, where $d$ is the common difference, so $$\n(x-2d)+(x-d)+x+(x+d)+(x+2d)=5x=540.\n$$Thus, $x=\\boxed{108}$.", "agents_response": "The sum of the angles in a pentagon is equal to $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees. Since $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ form an arithmetic sequence, the average of the angles can be found by $\\frac{v+z}{2} = \\frac{w+x+y}{3}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $v+z = 3w+3x+3y$. \n\nSince the sum of the angles of the pentagon is $540$ degrees, we have $v+w+x+y+z = 540$.\n\nSubstituting $v+z = 3w+3x+3y$ into the sum of the angles equation gives $2w+2x+2y = 540$.\n\nAlso, since $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are in arithmetic sequence, $y = x + d$ and $w = x - d$. Substituting these into $2w+2x+2y = 540$ gives $6x = 540$.\n\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{90}$ degrees."}
