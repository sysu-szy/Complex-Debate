{"question": "If the domain of the function $\\log x^2$ is $x < a$ or $x > b$, for some $a$ and $b$, find $a + b$.", "answer": "In order for $\\log x^2$ to be defined, we must have $x^2 > 0$. This true for all $x$, except for $x = 0$. It follows that the domain of this function is $x < 0$ or $x > 0$. Therefore, our answer is $0 + 0 = \\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "The domain of $\\log x^2$ is restricted by the fact that the argument of the logarithm must be greater than zero. Therefore, $x^2 > 0$, which implies that $x \\neq 0$. In other words, the domain of the function is all real numbers except $x = 0$, so $a = -\\infty$ and $b = \\infty$.\n\nTherefore, $a + b = -\\infty + \\infty = \\boxed{0}$."}
