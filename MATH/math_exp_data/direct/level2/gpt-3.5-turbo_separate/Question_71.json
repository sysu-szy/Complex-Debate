{"question": "Suppose that we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?", "answer": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.", "agents_response": "The probability of flipping a heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of flipping a tails is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. We can calculate the expected value by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing the results.\n\nWinnings if we flip heads: $\\$2$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$\nWinnings if we flip tails: $\\$-1$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nExpected value = $(2)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\boxed{\\$0}$."}
