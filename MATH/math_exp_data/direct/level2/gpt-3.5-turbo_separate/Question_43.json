{"question": "What is the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$?", "answer": "Subtracting $8$ from both sides of the inequality, we have $$13x < 27.$$ Dividing both sides by $13$ gives $$x < \\frac{27}{13}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$x < 2\\frac1{13}.$$ The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "To find the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$, first isolate $x$ by subtracting 8 from both sides:\n\n$13x + 8 - 8 < 35 - 8$\n\n$13x < 27$\n\nDivide by 13 on both sides:\n\n$x < \\frac{27}{13}$\n\nThe largest integer that is less than $\\frac{27}{13}$ is 2.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$ is $\\boxed{2}$."}
