{"question": "What is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system?", "answer": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": "To find the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$, we can use the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.\n\nSo, the distance is $\\sqrt{(-8-0)^2 + (6-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = \\boxed{10}$."}
