{"question": "A positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the smallest possible value of $X$?", "answer": "If a positive integer is 4 more than a multiple of 5, then its units digit must be 4 or 9.  We check positive integers ending in 4 or 9 until we find one which is 2 more than a multiple of 3: 4 is 1 more than a multiple of 3, 9 is a multiple of 3, and $\\boxed{14}$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3.", "agents_response": "We know that $X = 3k + 2$ and $Y = 5m + 4$, where $k$ and $m$ are integers. To find the smallest possible value of $X$, we need to find the smallest possible values of $k$ and $m such that the units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of $Y$.\n\nThe possible units digits of $X$ are 2, 5, and 8, since $3k$'s units digits can be 0, 3, 6, or 9.\n\nThe possible units digits of $Y$ are 4 and 9, since $5m$'s units digit can be 0 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the only units digit that occurs in both numbers is 9.\n\nThis implies that $X = 3k + 2$, for some integer $k$, must end in 9. So, $3k$ must end in 7, meaning $k$ ends in 9. The smallest positive integer $X$ can be is when $k = 9$, which gives $X = 3(9) + 2 = 29$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is $\\boxed{29}$."}
