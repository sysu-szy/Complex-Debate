{"question": "In a class of 50 students, 28 participate in MATHCOUNTS, 21 participate in science club, and 6 students participate in neither. How many students participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club?", "answer": "Among the $50-6=44$ students that participate in either MATHCOUNTS or science club, $44-28=16$ students do not participate in MATHCOUNTS.  All 16 of these students only participate in science club.  The other $21-16=\\boxed{5}$ science club participants participate in MATHCOUNTS as well.", "agents_response": "Let the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club be x.\n\nFrom the given information, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\nNumber of students who participate in MATHCOUNTS = 28\nNumber of students who participate in science club = 21\nNumber of students who participate in both = x\nNumber of students who participate in neither = 6\n\nTherefore, the total number of students participating in MATHCOUNTS or science club is:\n28 + 21 - x + 6\n\nBut, this total should be equal to the total number of students in the class, which is 50. So, we can write the equation:\n28 + 21 - x + 6 = 50\n55 - x = 50\nx = 55 - 50\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, 5 students participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club.\n\n\\boxed{5}"}
