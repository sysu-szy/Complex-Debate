{"question": "A positive integer is 3 more than a multiple of 4 and 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the least integer it could be?", "answer": "Let our integer be $n$.  Then $n = 4i + 3 = 5j + 4$ for positive integers $i,j$.  Thus $4i = 5j + 1$, to which the smallest possible solutions are $(i,j) = (4,3)$.  Thus $\\boxed{19}$ is the smallest possible value for $n$.", "agents_response": "The least integer that fits this criteria is the least common multiple of 4 and 5 plus 4. The least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20, so when you add 4 to that, you get 24.\n\n\\boxed{24}"}
