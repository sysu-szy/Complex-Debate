{"question": "A paper cone is to be made from a three-quarter circle having radius 4 inches (shaded). What is the length of the arc on the discarded quarter-circle (dotted portion)? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(80);\nimport graph;\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,90),linetype(\"2 4\"));\nfilldraw((0,0)--(0,1)--Arc((0,0),1,90,360)--cycle,gray(.6),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$4''$\",(.5,0),S,fontsize(12pt));[/asy]", "answer": "The total circumference of the original circle was $2\\cdot 4 \\cdot \\pi = 8\\pi$.  The quarter-circle has length that is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this, or $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 8\\pi = \\boxed{2\\pi}$ inches.", "agents_response": "The circumference of a whole circle with radius 4 inches is $2\\pi(4)=8\\pi$ inches. Since the quarter-circle makes up three-fourths of a whole circle, the circumference of the quarter-circle is $\\frac{3}{4}(8\\pi)=6\\pi$ inches. Therefore, the length of the arc on the discarded quarter-circle is $\\boxed{6\\pi \\text{ inches}}$."}
