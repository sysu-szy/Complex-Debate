{"question": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be the roots of $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0.$ Find $abc + a + b + c.$", "answer": "By Vieta's formulas, $abc = -\\tfrac 52$ and $a+b+c = - \\tfrac 32$. Thus, $abc+a+b+c=-\\tfrac52-\\tfrac32 = \\boxed{-4}.$", "agents_response": "We know that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by $- \\frac{b}{a},$ the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is given by $\\frac{c}{a},$ and the product of the roots is given by $- \\frac{d}{a}$, where the polynomial is $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d.$\n\nIn this case, we have $a+b+c = -\\frac{3}{2}$ and $ab+ac+bc = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.$ Multiplying both sides of the equations gives $a^2b+abc+abc+acb+b^2c+abc=abc(a+b+c) + ab+ac+bc = abc \\cdot -\\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5,$ so $abc = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}.$"}
