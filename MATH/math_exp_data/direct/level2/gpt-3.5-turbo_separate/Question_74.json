{"question": "If $5x - 3 = 12$, what is the value of $5x + 3$?", "answer": "Adding 6 to both sides of $5x - 3 =12$ gives $5x -3 + 6 = 12 + 6$.  Simplifying both sides gives $5x + 3 = \\boxed{18}$.", "agents_response": "To find the value of $5x + 3$, we first need to solve for $x$ in the equation $5x - 3 = 12$.\n\nAdding 3 to both sides, we get:\n$5x = 15$\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n$x = 3$\n\nNow, substituting $x = 3$ into the expression $5x + 3$, we get:\n$5(3) + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18$\n\nTherefore, the value of $5x + 3$ is $\\boxed{18}$."}
