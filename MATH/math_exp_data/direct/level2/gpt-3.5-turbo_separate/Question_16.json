{"question": "What is the remainder when $7438+7439+7440+7441+7442+7443+7444+7445$ is divided by $8$?", "answer": "Since $7438,7439,\\ldots,7445$ are $8$ consecutive integers, they include exactly one integer from each residue class $\\pmod 8$. Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod 8$ to $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod 8$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "Taking the sum $7438+7439+7440+7441+7442+7443+7444+7445$ modulo $8$,\n$= 2+3+4+5+6+7+0+1 \\pmod{8}$\n$= 0+0+2+2+4+4+1+1 \\pmod{8}$\n$= 12 \\pmod{8} = \\boxed{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $7438+7439+7440+7441+7442+7443+7444+7445$ is divided by $8$ is $\\boxed{4}$."}
