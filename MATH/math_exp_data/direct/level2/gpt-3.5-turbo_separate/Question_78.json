{"question": "What is the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$?", "answer": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$.", "agents_response": "Let the three-digit number be $\\overline{abc}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the digits.\n\nWe are given that $a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 12$. Since the number is a three-digit number, $a$ must be at least $1$. Since we want the largest three-digit number, we want $a$ to be as large as possible.\n\nConsidering the factors of $12$ (ignoring $1$ since $a \\geq 1$), our options for $a$, $b$, and $c$ are:\n$(a, b, c) = (3, 2, 2)$\n$(a, b, c) = (4, 3, 1)$\n\nThe largest three-digit number is when $a=4$, $b=3$, and $c=1$, which gives $\\boxed{431}$."}
