{"question": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds $164$. Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. What number does she subtract?", "answer": "We see that $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 40^2 - 4\\cdot 40 +4 = 40^2 - 156$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$.", "agents_response": "We have $40^2 = 1600$ and $42^2 = 1600 + 164 = 1764$.\n\nLet the number Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$ be $x$. Then, we have $40^2 - x = 38^2$. \n\nSince $38^2 = 1444$, we have $1600 - x = 1444$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 1600 - 1444 = 156$.\n\nTherefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$ to calculate $38^2$."}
