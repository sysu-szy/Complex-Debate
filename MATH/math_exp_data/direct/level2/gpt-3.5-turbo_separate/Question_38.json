{"question": "The sum of four consecutive positive even integers is a perfect square. What is the least possible sum?", "answer": "Let $2n-2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$ be four consecutive positive even integers. If $(2n-2)+(2n)+(2n+2)+(2n+4)=8n+4=2^2(2n+1)=m^2$ for some positive integer $m$, then $2n+1$ must be an odd perfect square. $2n+1=1^2$ gives $n=0$, which we reject because our integers are positive. $2n+1=3^2$ gives $n=4$, which yields a sum of $8\\times4+4=36$. Thus, the least possible sum is $\\boxed{36}$.", "agents_response": "Let the four consecutive positive even integers be represented as 2n, 2n+2, 2n+4, and 2n+6.\n\nTheir sum is:\n2n + (2n+2) + (2n+4) + (2n+6)\n8n + 12\n\nTo find the least possible sum that is a perfect square, we need to find the smallest possible value of n such that 8n + 12 is a perfect square.\n\nLet's set 8n + 12 equal to a perfect square:\n8n + 12 = x^2\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n8n = x^2 - 12\n\nSince 8n is divisible by 8, x^2 - 12 must also be divisible by 8.\nThis implies that x^2 is congruent to 12 mod 8.\n\nTrying out values of x:\nx = 4 -> 4^2 = 16 (which is congruent to 0 mod 8, not 12)\nx = 6 -> 6^2 = 36 (which is congruent to 4 mod 8, not 12)\nx = 8 -> 8^2 = 64 (which is congruent to 0 mod 8, not 12)\n\nIt seems that x = 10 is the smallest integer value that satisfies the condition:\n10^2 = 100 (which is congruent to 4 mod 8)\n\nSubstitute x = 10 back into the equation to find n:\n8n = 10^2 - 12\n8n = 100 - 12\n8n = 88\nn = 11\n\nTherefore, the sum of the four consecutive positive even integers that results in the least possible sum that is a perfect square is:\n\\boxed{48}"}
