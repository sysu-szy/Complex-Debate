{"question": "The expression $10x^2-x-24$ can be written as $(Ax-8)(Bx+3),$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is $AB + B$?", "answer": "We see that $10x^2-x-24=(5x-8)(2x+3)$, thus $A = 5$ and $B = 2$. Hence, $AB + B = \\boxed{12}.$", "agents_response": "We can expand $(Ax-8)(Bx+3)$ to get $ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24$. \n\nComparing coefficients with $10x^2-x-24$, we get:\n$AB = 10$,\n$3A - 8B = -1$.\n\nFrom $AB = 10$, we know that $A=10$ and $B=1$. \n\nSubstitute these values back into $3A - 8B = -1$ to get $3(10) - 8(1) = 30 - 8 = 22$. \n\nTherefore, $AB + B = 10 \\cdot 1 + 1 = \\boxed{11}$."}
