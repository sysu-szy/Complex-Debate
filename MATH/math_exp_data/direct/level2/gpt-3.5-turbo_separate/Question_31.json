{"question": "John is 31 years younger than his dad. The sum of their ages is 53 years. How many years old is John's dad?", "answer": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.", "agents_response": "Let J represent John's age and let D represent John's dad's age. \n\nWe know that John is 31 years younger than his dad, so J = D - 31.\n\nWe also know that the sum of their ages is 53 years, so J + D = 53.\n\nSubstituting J = D - 31 into the second equation, we get (D - 31) + D = 53.\nCombining like terms, we get 2D - 31 = 53.\nAdding 31 to both sides, we get 2D = 84.\nDividing by 2, we get D = 42.\n\nTherefore, John's dad is \\boxed{42} years old."}
