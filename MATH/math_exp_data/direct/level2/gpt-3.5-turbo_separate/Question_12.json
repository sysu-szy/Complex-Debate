{"question": "What is the smallest positive integer solution to $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$?", "answer": "The fraction's numerator is equal to $10^8$, or $100^4$.  Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find that $\\frac{100}{x} < 1$, meaning that $100<x$ (since $x$ is positive).  So $x = \\boxed{101}$ is the smallest positive integer solution.", "agents_response": "To solve this inequality, we need to first isolate the variable $x$.\nGiven that we are looking for a positive integer solution, we know that $x$ has to be greater than 1. \n\nWe can rewrite the inequality as:\n$100,000,000 < x^4$\nTaking the fourth root on both sides, we get:\n$100^{\\frac{1}{4}} < x$\n\nCalculating the fourth root of 100, we get:\n$100^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 1000$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer solution to the inequality is $\\boxed{1000}$."}
