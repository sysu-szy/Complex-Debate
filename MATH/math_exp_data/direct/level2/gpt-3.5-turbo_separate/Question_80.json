{"question": "In the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10, what is the next number?", "answer": "The row that starts 1, 10 is the row $\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2},\\ldots$, so the next number is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{45}$.", "agents_response": "To find the next number in the row of Pascal's triangle, we must calculate the next combination. The next number in the row can be found by calculating:\n\n10C1 = 10\n\nTherefore, the next number in the row of Pascal's triangle is 10. \n\n\\boxed{10}"}
