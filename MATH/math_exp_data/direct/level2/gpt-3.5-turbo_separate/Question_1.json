{"question": "If $y=\\frac{27x^2+9x+3}{27x^3+9x^2+3x+1}$, at what value of $y$ will there be a horizontal asymptote?", "answer": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "To find where a horizontal asymptote occurs, we look at the leading terms of the numerator and denominator. In this case, the leading terms are $27x^2$ and $27x^3$.\n\nSince the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ where there will be a horizontal asymptote is $\\boxed{0}$."}
