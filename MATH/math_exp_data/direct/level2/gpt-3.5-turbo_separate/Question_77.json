{"question": "Find $x$ such that $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$.", "answer": "Since $7^2 = 49$, it follows $\\log_x 49 = 2$. Writing this equation in exponential notation gives $x^2 = 49$. Solving this gives $x = \\pm 7$, but the base of a logarithm cannot be negative, so $x = \\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "Since $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$, we know that $\\log_x 49 = 2$ (since $7^2 = 49$). Therefore, we have $x^2 = 49$, which means $x = \\pm 7$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\pm 7}$."}
