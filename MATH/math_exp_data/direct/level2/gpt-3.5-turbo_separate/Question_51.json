{"question": "How many integers in the list $25,$ $26,$ $27,$ $\\dots,$ $250$ are not perfect cubes?", "answer": "There are $250-25+1 = 226$ numbers in the list $25, 26, \\ldots, 250$.  We can find four perfect cubes in the list, namely $3^3,\\ldots,6^3$.  So the number of non-perfect-cubes in the list is $226-4=\\boxed{222}$.", "agents_response": "To find the integers that are perfect cubes in the list, we look for cubes between 25 and 250.\nThe cubes closest to 25 and 250 are $3^3=27$ and $6^3=216$. \nThus, all perfect cubes in the list are $27,$ $64,$ $125,$ $216$. \nThere are 4 perfect cubes. \nThe total number of integers in the list is $250-25+1=226$. \nTherefore, the number of integers that are not perfect cubes is $226-4=\\boxed{222}$."}
