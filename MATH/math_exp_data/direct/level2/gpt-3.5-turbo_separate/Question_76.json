{"question": "The sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 153, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.7. What is the value of $y - x$?", "answer": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$.", "agents_response": "Let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\nEquation 1: $x + y = 153$\nEquation 2: $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.7$\n\nFrom equation 1, we have $x = 153 - y$.\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\n$\\frac{153 - y}{y} = 0.7$\n\n$153 - y = 0.7y$\n\n$153 = 1.7y$\n\n$y = \\frac{153}{1.7} = 90$\n\nSubstitute $y = 90$ back into equation 1 to find $x$:\n\n$x = 153 - 90 = 63$\n\nCalculate $y - x$:\n\n$y - x = 90 - 63 = 27$\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{27}$ is the value of $y - x$."}
