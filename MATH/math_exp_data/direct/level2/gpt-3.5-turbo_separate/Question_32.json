{"question": "The temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?", "answer": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "The temperature rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes, which can be simplified to a rate of $1.5/15 = 0.1$ degrees per minute.\n\nSince there are $60$ minutes in an hour, the temperature will rise $0.1 \\cdot 60 = 6$ degrees in the next hour.\n\nIn $2$ hours, the temperature will rise $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ degrees.\n\nTherefore, the temperature will rise $12$ degrees in the next $2$ hours. \n\n\\boxed{12}"}
