{"question": "How many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.", "answer": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi.\\] Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$ yields $r^2 = 49$; taking the square root of both sides and keeping the positive solution yields $r=7$ inches.\n\nA great circle of a sphere is the circular cross-section of the sphere that passes through the sphere's center, which, in this case, is a circle with radius 7.  The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches.", "agents_response": "The formula for the surface area of a sphere is $4\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. \n\nGiven that the surface area of the sphere is $196\\pi$ sq in, we can set up the equation $4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi$. \n\nDividing both sides by $4\\pi$, we get $r^2 = 49$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $r = 7$.\n\nThe circumference of the great circle of the sphere is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi \\cdot 7 = 14\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{14\\pi}$."}
