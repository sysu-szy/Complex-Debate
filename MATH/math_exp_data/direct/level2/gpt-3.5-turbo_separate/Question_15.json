{"question": "The fair spinner shown is spun once. What is the probability of spinning an odd number?

Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is $\\frac{180+90}{360}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.", "agents_response": "There are 3 equally likely outcomes on the spinner, which are 14, 15, and 23. Out of these numbers, only 15 is odd. Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is 1/3.\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}"}
