{"question": "Let $f(n)$ return the number of times $n$ appears in Pascal's Triangle. For example, $f(3) = 2$ and $f(4) = 2$. If $n$ is a positive integer, what is the minimum value of $f(n)$?", "answer": "Every positive integer appears at least once; if we consider an arbitrary integer $k$, it can be written in the form $\\binom{k}{1}$. Almost all integers can be written twice, because $\\binom{k}{1} = \\binom{k}{k-1} = k$, but when $k-1 = 1$, the two occurrences overlap into one. This takes place for $k = 2$, and $2$ only appears once in Pascal's Triangle, because succeeding rows of Pascal's Triangle only contain $1$'s and numbers greater than $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.", "agents_response": "To find the minimum value of $f(n)$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n$ appears in Pascal's Triangle. \n\nAt the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle, the $k$th number is given by $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. Therefore, $n$ appears in Pascal's Triangle when $\\binom{n-1}{n-1} = \\binom{n-1}{0} = 1$. \n\nThis means the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $1$ when $n = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{1}$."}
