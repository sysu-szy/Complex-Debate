{"question": "In triangle $ABC$, the measure of angle $A$ is $x$ degrees, the measure of angle $B$ is $2x$ degrees and the measure of angle $C$ is $5x$ degrees. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "answer": "The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we have the equation $x+2x+5x=180$, so $x=\\boxed{22.5}$.", "agents_response": "The sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180$ degrees. So, we have the equation:\n\n$x + 2x + 5x = 180$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$8x = 180$\n\n$x = \\frac{180}{8}$\n\n$x = 22.5$\n\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{22.5}$."}
