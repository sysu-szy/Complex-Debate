{"question": "Suppose that we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?", "answer": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.", "agents_response": "The expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and adding these products together. The probability of getting heads is $0.5$. If we get heads, we win $\\$2$. So the contribution of this outcome to the expected value is $2 \\cdot 0.5 = \\$1$. \n\nThe probability of getting tails is also $0.5$. If we get tails, we lose $\\$1$. So the contribution of this outcome to the expected value is $-1 \\cdot 0.5 = -\\$0.50$. \n\nTherefore, the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip is $1 - 0.50 = \\$0.50$. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{0.50}."}
