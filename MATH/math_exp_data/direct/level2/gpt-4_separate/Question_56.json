{"question": "A movie theater seats $100$ patrons. The theater is full for the 5:00 pm Saturday movie. Adult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each and children's tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each. If the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show, how many children's tickets were sold?", "answer": "We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as $a$ and the number of children's tickets sold as $c$.\nBecause the theater was full, we know that $a + c = 100$.\nSince adult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each and children's tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, the total revenue from ticket sales would be $9a + 5c$. We know that this total is $\\$640$, so we get the equation $9a + 5c = 640$.\nWe now have a system of two equations. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. I choose to use substitution, substituting $c = 100 - a$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$9a + 5(100 - a) = 640$, or\n$9a + 500 - 5a = 640$, or\n$4a = 140$.\nSolving for $a$, we find $a = 35$, so 35 adult tickets were sold.\nSubstituting $a = 35$ back into the first equation, we find $c = 100 - 35 = 65$.\nSo, \\boxed{65} children's tickets were sold."}
