{"question": "Compute: $\\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2}$", "answer": "Factor $3^3$ out of the numerator and $3^2$ out of the denominator before subtracting: \\[\n\\frac{3^4-3^3}{3^3-3^2}=\\frac{3^3(3-1)}{3^2(3-1)}=\\boxed{3}.\n\\]", "agents_response": "The problem can be simplified by factoring out the common terms in both numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: $3^4-3^3 = 3^3(3 - 1)$.\n\nDenominator: $3^3-3^2 = 3^2(3-1)$.\n\nSubstituting the factored terms back into the original problem, we get $\\frac{3^3(3 - 1)}{3^2(3-1)}$.\n\nThe $3-1$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out each other, and this can be simplified further to $\\frac{3^3}{3^2}$.\n\nDividing $3^3$ by $3^2$ simplifies further to $3$.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{3}."}
