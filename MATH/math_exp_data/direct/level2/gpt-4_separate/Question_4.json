{"question": "Evaluate $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor$.", "answer": "Because $\\sqrt{25}<\\sqrt{26}<\\sqrt{27}<\\sqrt{36}$, we have $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil=6$ and $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor=5$.  The expression thus evaluates to $6-5=\\boxed{1}$.", "agents_response": "The square root of 27 is approximately 5.196. The ceiling of this number is 6, since it rounds up to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe square root of 26 is approximately 5.099. The floor of this number is 5, since it rounds down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor = 6 - 5 = 1$.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{1}."}
