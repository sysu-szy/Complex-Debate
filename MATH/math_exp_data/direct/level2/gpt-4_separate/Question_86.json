{"question": "The solution to $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$ is expressed in the form $a < x < b$. Find the value of $a + b$.", "answer": "Since everything in sight is even, we should begin by dividing by 2.  That gives \\[-2<x-1<4.\\] To isolate $x$, we add 1, so \\[-1<x<5.\\] Since $a=-1$ and $b=5$, we get $a+b=-1+5=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "To solve the inequality $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$, we should first divide every part of the inequality by 2. This gives us $-2 < x - 1 < 4$. \n\nNext, we add 1 to all parts of the inequality to isolate x in the middle. This gives us $-1 < x < 5$. \n\nSo, we have $a = -1$ and $b = 5$, and the sum $a + b$ is equal to $-1 + 5 = 4$.\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{4}."}
