{"question": "On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs?", "answer": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $\\boxed{63}$ ligs are equivalent.", "agents_response": "First, we need to express the conversion rates as ratios, from which we can calculate the number of ligs equal to one lug.\n\n7 ligs = 4 lags, so one lag equals 7/4 ligs.\n\n9 lags = 20 lugs. Therefore, one lug equals 9/20 lags.\n\nTherefore, one lug in ligs is (7/4) * (9/20) = 63/80 ligs. To find the equivalent of 80 lugs, we simply multiply 63/80 by 80, which is 63.\n\nTherefore, 80 lugs are equivalent to \\boxed{63} ligs."}
