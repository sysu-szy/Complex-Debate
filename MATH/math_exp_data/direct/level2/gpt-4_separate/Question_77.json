{"question": "Find $x$ such that $7^{\\log_x 49} = 49$.", "answer": "Since $7^2 = 49$, it follows $\\log_x 49 = 2$. Writing this equation in exponential notation gives $x^2 = 49$. Solving this gives $x = \\pm 7$, but the base of a logarithm cannot be negative, so $x = \\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that both 7 and 49 are powers of 7:\n\n7 = $7^1$\n\n49 = $7^2$\n\nWe can then rewrite the problem in terms of these powers to better see what it is asking:\n\n$7^{log_x (7^2)} = 7^2$\n\nThe question is asking what value of x will make $log_x (7^2)$ equal to 2. Any logarithm base other than 1 that turns a number into its square (or cube, etc.) is 2.\n\nSo, in this problem, $x$ is \\boxed{7}."}
