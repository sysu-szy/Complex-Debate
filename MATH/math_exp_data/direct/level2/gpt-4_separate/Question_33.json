{"question": "Find the sum of all solutions of the equation $|2-x|= 3$.", "answer": "In order to have $|2-x| = 3$, we must have $2-x = 3$ or $2-x = -3$.  If $2-x = 3$, then $x=-1$, and if $2-x = -3$, then $x = 5$.  The sum of these solutions is $(-1) + 5 = \\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "To solve $|2-x|=3$, we first consider when $2-x=3$, which gives $x=-1$. Then, we consider when $2-x=-3$, which gives $x=5$. Thus, the sum of all solutions is $(-1)+5 = 4$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{4}$."}
