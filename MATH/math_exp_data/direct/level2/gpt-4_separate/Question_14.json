{"question": "Given that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, what is the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$?", "answer": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the known digits: $5+9+1+3+8 = 26$. The numbers that when added to 26 result in another number divisible by 3 are 1, 4 and 7.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4. Therefore, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. The following numbers divisible by 4 end in 8: 08, 28, 48, 68, 88. Therefore, the possible values for $d$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nThe only digits that satisfy both conditions (divisible by 3 when added to 26 and forms a number ending in 8 that is divisible by 4) are 4 and 8.  Therefore, the sum of all possible digits that could replace $d$ is $4+8 = \\boxed{12}$."}
