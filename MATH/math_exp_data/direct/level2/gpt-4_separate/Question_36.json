{"question": "At a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?", "answer": "From ``$3$'' to ``$9$'' is a difference of 6 hours out of the 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$ of the degrees on the clock. From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock. Since the clock has $360^\\circ$, the angle decreases by $\\frac{360}{6}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$.", "agents_response": "A clock face is a circle, and a circle consists of 360 degrees. Thus, each number on the clock face represents an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees apart from its neighbor. If two hands of the clock are on \"3\" and \"9\", the angle between them is 180 degrees because they are 6 numbers apart, so 6 * 30 = 180 degrees.\n\nIf the hands are on \"2\" and \"10\", they are 4 numbers apart. Therefore, the angle is 4 * 30 = 120 degrees.\n\nThe decrease in angle is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees. \nSo, the angle decreased by \\boxed{60} degrees."}
