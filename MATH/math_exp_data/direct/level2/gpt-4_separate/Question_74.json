{"question": "If $5x - 3 = 12$, what is the value of $5x + 3$?", "answer": "Adding 6 to both sides of $5x - 3 =12$ gives $5x -3 + 6 = 12 + 6$.  Simplifying both sides gives $5x + 3 = \\boxed{18}$.", "agents_response": "To find the value of $5x + 3$, we first need to find the value of $x$. \n\nBeginning with the equation $5x - 3 = 12$, we add 3 to both sides to isolate $5x$ on one side: \n\n$5x - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3$ \n\nwhich simplifies to \n\n$5x = 15$.\n\nDividing both sides by 5 then gives \n\n$x = 15/5 = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $x = 3$ into the expression $5x + 3$ gives\n\n$5(3) + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18$. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{18}."}
