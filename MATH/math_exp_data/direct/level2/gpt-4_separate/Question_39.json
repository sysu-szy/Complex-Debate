{"question": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds $164$. Emily subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. What number does she subtract?", "answer": "We see that $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 40^2 - 4\\cdot 40 +4 = 40^2 - 156$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$.", "agents_response": "The method Emily uses to calculate squares numbers is likely based on the identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ where a and b are real numbers.\n\nWe can use this identity to find out what number Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to get $38^2$.\n\nWhich can also be expressed as $38^2 = (40-2)^2 = 40^2 - 2*40*2 + 2^2 $\n\nTherefore, the number Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$ is $2*40*2 - 2^2 = 160-4 = 156.$\n\nSo, \\boxed{156} is the number that Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$."}
