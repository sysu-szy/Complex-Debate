{"question": "John is 31 years younger than his dad. The sum of their ages is 53 years. How many years old is John's dad?", "answer": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.", "agents_response": "Let's denote John's age as J and his dad's age as D. From the problem, we have the following two equations:\n\n1) D = J + 31 (John is 31 years younger than his dad)\n2) J + D = 53 (The sum of their ages is 53 years)\n\nTo find D's age, we can substitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\nJ + (J+31) = 53\n2J + 31 = 53\n2J = 53 - 31\n2J = 22\nJ = 22 / 2\nJ = 11.\n\nSubstituting J = 11 into equation 1, we get:\n\nD = 11 + 31\nD = 42.\n\nSo, John's dad is 42 years old.\n\nSo, \\boxed{42}."}
