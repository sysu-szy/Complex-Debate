{"question": "If $*$ represents an operation defined by $a*b=a^b+b$, find $(1*2)*3$.", "answer": "We have: $(1*2)*3=(1^2+2)*3=3*3=3^3+3=27+3=\\boxed{30}$.", "agents_response": "First, let's find $1*2$. According to the operation defined, we substitute $a=1$ and $b=2$ to get $1^2+2=1+2=3$.\nNext, compute $(1*2)*3$, which is now $3*3$ after finding $1*2=3$. Again, substitute $a=3$ and $b=3$ in the operation defined to get $3^3+3 = 27+3=30$. Therefore, $\\boxed{30}$ is the final simplified answer."}
