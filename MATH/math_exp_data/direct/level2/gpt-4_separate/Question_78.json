{"question": "What is the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$?", "answer": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$.", "agents_response": "To get the largest three-digit number, we want the hundreds digit to be as large as possible. So we try to make the other two digits as small as possible. Looking at the factors of 12, ($1,12$ , $2,6$ , $3,4$), it appears that using 3 and 4 will allow us to make the hundreds digit the largest (since the product of the other two digits will be smaller).\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit number would be $\\boxed{431}$."}
