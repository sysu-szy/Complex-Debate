{"question": "Let $\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\pi} \\\\ -14 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Compute $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}).$", "answer": "The vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}$ are always orthogonal, so their dot product is $\\boxed{0}.$", "agents_response": "This question is asking for the dot product of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ with the cross product of the vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. The answer to this calculation is actually incredibly simple. $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b})$ always yields zero. This is because $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are in the same plane, while their cross product $\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}$ is perpendicular to this plane, and thus perpendicular to $\\mathbf{a}$. The dot product of perpendicular vectors is always zero. \nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{0}$."}
