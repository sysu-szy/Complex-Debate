{"question": "What is the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$?", "answer": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is the magnitude of their difference. Therefore our distance is $|(5+6i)-(-2+2i)|=|7+4i|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$.", "agents_response": "The distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the absolute value of the difference of the two complex numbers. \n\nSo, the distance is $|5+6i - (-2+2i)| = |7+4i|$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find that this is equal to $\\sqrt{7^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{49+16} = \\sqrt{65}$. \n\nTherefore, the distance in the complex plane between $5+6i$ and $-2+2i$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}$."}
