{"question": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?", "answer": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days.", "agents_response": "The original supplies were intended to last for 12 people for 10 days, so there were 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 person-days of supplies. If they are joined by three more people, there are now 12+3 = <<12+3=15>>15 people sharing the supplies. Therefore, the supplies will last 120/15 = <<120/15=8>>8 days.\nSo, \\boxed{8}."}
