{"question": "Suppose $f(x) = -x^2+3x+4$ and $g(x) = -2x^3+9x^2-x-12$. Every root of $f(x)$ is also a root of $g(x)$. What is the third root of $g(x)$ (that is not a root of $f(x)$)?", "answer": "Since the roots of $f(x)$ are roots of $g(x)$, and $\\deg f < \\deg g$, we guess that $f(x)$ is a factor of $g(x)$. In other words, we guess that we can write $g(x) = f(x)q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x)$. If that is the case, then any root of $f(x)$ will also be a root of $g(x)$.\n\nDividing $g(x)$ by $f(x)$ gives us\n$$-2x^3+9x^2-x-12=(-x^2+3x+4)(2x-3)$$so we can see that $x = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$ is the third root of $g(x)$.\n\nIt is also easy to verify that $-1$ and $4$ are roots of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ (the roots can be found by factoring $f(x)$).", "agents_response": "First, we find the roots of $f(x) = -x^2+3x+4$. The roots are found by setting $-x^2+3x+4=0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation which can be solved by using the formula $x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ \n\nIn this equation, a=-1, b=3, and c=4. \n\nSo, the roots are $x=\\frac{-(3) \\pm \\sqrt{(3)^2 -4(-1)(4)}}{2(-1)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{-2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{-2}$\n\nwhich simplifies to $x=-1,4$.\n\nWith the knowledge that $f(x)$ roots are also roots of $g(x)$, to find the third root of g(x) we can divide the polynomial $g(x)$ by $(x+1)$ and $(x-4)$. \n\n$g(x)$ can be factored as $(x+1)(x-4)(-2x+3)$\n\nSetting $-2x+3=0$ gives the third root $x=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the third root of $g(x)$ is \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}."}
