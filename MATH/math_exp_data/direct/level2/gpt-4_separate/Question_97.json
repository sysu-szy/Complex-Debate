{"question": "A positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the smallest possible value of $X$?", "answer": "If a positive integer is 4 more than a multiple of 5, then its units digit must be 4 or 9.  We check positive integers ending in 4 or 9 until we find one which is 2 more than a multiple of 3: 4 is 1 more than a multiple of 3, 9 is a multiple of 3, and $\\boxed{14}$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3.", "agents_response": "A number that is 2 more than a multiple of 3 could be 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. A number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 could be 4, 9, 14, etc. We want the units digit of both these sets to be the same, which first happens with 5 and 4. So, the smallest possible value of X is \\boxed{5}."}
