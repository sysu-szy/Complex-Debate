{"question": "How many integers in the list $25,$ $26,$ $27,$ $\\dots,$ $250$ are not perfect cubes?", "answer": "There are $250-25+1 = 226$ numbers in the list $25, 26, \\ldots, 250$.  We can find four perfect cubes in the list, namely $3^3,\\ldots,6^3$.  So the number of non-perfect-cubes in the list is $226-4=\\boxed{222}$.", "agents_response": "The list $25, 26, 27, \\dots, 250$ contains 226 integers. \n\nThe perfect cubes in this range are $27, 64, 125, 216$. There are 4 of them.\n\nSo, there are $226 - 4 = 222$ integers in that list that are not perfect cubes. \n\nSo, $\\boxed{222}$ is the number of integers in the list that are not perfect cubes."}
