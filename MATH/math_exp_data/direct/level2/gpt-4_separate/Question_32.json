{"question": "The temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?", "answer": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "The temperature rises $1.5$ degrees every $15$ minutes. So, $1$ hour, which is $60$ minutes, would have $\\frac{60}{15} = 4$ sets of $15$ minutes. Thus, the temperature rise in $1$ hour is $4 * 1.5=6$ degrees. \n\nThe problem asks for the temperature rise over $2$ hours, so the total temperature rise is $2 * 6=12$ degrees.\n\n\\boxed{12}."}
