{"question": "The expression $10x^2-x-24$ can be written as $(Ax-8)(Bx+3),$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is $AB + B$?", "answer": "We see that $10x^2-x-24=(5x-8)(2x+3)$, thus $A = 5$ and $B = 2$. Hence, $AB + B = \\boxed{12}.$", "agents_response": "Comparing the given expression to its factored form, we see that $A\\cdot B=10$, and $-AB=1$, and $A+B=-1$. Solving these equations, we get $A=2$ and $B=5$. Plugging $A$ and $B$ into the expression we need to find, we get $2\\cdot 5 + 5 = 15$. So $AB + B = \\boxed{15}$."}
