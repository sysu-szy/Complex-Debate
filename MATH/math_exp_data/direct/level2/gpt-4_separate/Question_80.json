{"question": "In the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10, what is the next number?", "answer": "The row that starts 1, 10 is the row $\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2},\\ldots$, so the next number is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{45}$.", "agents_response": "The next number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10 is found by adding the two numbers directly above it on the previous row. In this case, those two numbers are 5 and 5 (from the row that starts with 1, 9, 36, 84, 126). Therefore, the next number is 5 + 5 = 10. So, the row starts with 1, 10, 10. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{10}."}
