{"question": "One cube has a volume of 343 cubic centimeters. The edge length of a second cube is three times the edge length of this first cube. What is the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube, in cubic centimeters?", "answer": "By homothety, the second cube has a volume that is $3^3 = 27$ times that of the first.  Hence the difference in the cubes' volumes is $27\\cdot 343 - 343 = \\boxed{8918}$ cubic centimeters.", "agents_response": "The volume of a cube is given by the equation V = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube. Since the first cube has a volume of 343 cubic centimeters, its side length is the cube root of 343, or 7 centimeters.\n\nThe second cube has a side length that is three times the side length of the first cube, or 21 centimeters. Therefore, the volume of the second cube is 21^3 = 9261 cubic centimeters.\n\nThe difference between the volumes of the two cubes is 9261 - 343 = 8918 cubic centimeters. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{8918}."}
