{"question": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word NINE.", "answer": "First we count the arrangements if the two N's are unique, which is 4!. Then since the N's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ for the arrangements of the N's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2!} = \\boxed{12}$.", "agents_response": "The word \"NINE\" has 4 letters - 2 of which are identical (N).\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\" can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset: n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!), where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the counts of each distinct item.\n\nHere, n = 4 (the total number of letters), r1 = 2 (the number of \"N\"s), and all other letters are unique, so their counts are 1.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get: 4! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1!).\n\nThis simplifies to (4*3*2*1) / (2*1) = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word \"NINE\".\n\n\\boxed{12}."}
