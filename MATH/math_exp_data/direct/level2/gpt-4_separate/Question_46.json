{"question": "A positive integer is 3 more than a multiple of 4 and 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the least integer it could be?", "answer": "Let our integer be $n$.  Then $n = 4i + 3 = 5j + 4$ for positive integers $i,j$.  Thus $4i = 5j + 1$, to which the smallest possible solutions are $(i,j) = (4,3)$.  Thus $\\boxed{19}$ is the smallest possible value for $n$.", "agents_response": "Firstly, the problem tells us that the integer is 3 more than a multiple of 4, so we can represent this as 4t + 3, where t is some integer.\n\nSecondly, it tells us that the integer is 4 more than a multiple of 5, so we can represent this as 5s + 4, where s is some integer.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation 4t + 3 = 5s + 4. Solving for t, we find that t = (5s + 1) / 4.\n\nSince t and s are both integers, 5s + 1 must be a multiple of 4. The smallest positive integer value that fulfills this requirement is when s = 1, in which case we have 5(1) + 1 = 6.\n\nPlugging s = 1 into our equation gives us t = (5(1) + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5.\n\nThis is not an integer, so we look for the next value of s for which 5s + 1 is a multiple of 4. We find this is true for s = 3, in which case we have 5(3) + 1 = 16.\n\nPlugging s = 3 into our equation gives us t = (5(3) + 1) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4. \n\nSo, if t = 4 and s = 3, then our integer is 4*4 + 3 = 5*3 + 4 = \\boxed{19}."}
