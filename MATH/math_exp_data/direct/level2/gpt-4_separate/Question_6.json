{"question": "What is the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$?", "answer": "We can write $\\frac{123}{999}$ as $0.\\overline{123}$. To see why, let $x=0.\\overline{123}$, and subtract $x$ from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 123&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.123123123\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 123 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{123} = \\frac{123}{999}$.\n\nThis decimal repeats every 3 digits. Since $123{,}999$ is divisible by $3$ (as the sum of the digits of $123{,}999$ is equal to $33$), it follows that $123{,}999^{\\rm th}$ digit after the decimal point is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, namely $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "The decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$ is 0.123123123..., which repeats every three digits. To find the 123,999th digit after the decimal, we divide 123,999 by 3. Since this division has no remainder, the 123,999th digit is the third digit in the repeating sequence, which is 3. \n\nSo, the 123,999th digit after the decimal in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{123}{999}$ is \\boxed{3}."}
