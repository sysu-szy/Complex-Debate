{"question": "What is the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$?", "answer": "Subtracting $8$ from both sides of the inequality, we have $$13x < 27.$$ Dividing both sides by $13$ gives $$x < \\frac{27}{13}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$x < 2\\frac1{13}.$$ The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "Subtract 8 from both sides of the inequality to get: 13x < 27. Then, divide both sides by 13 to get: x < 27/13. This means that x is less than approximately 2.08. Since we are looking for the largest integer solution, we round 2.08 down to the nearest whole number, 2. However, since x is less than 2.08, 2 is actually not a valid solution. So the largest integer that is a solution is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}."}
