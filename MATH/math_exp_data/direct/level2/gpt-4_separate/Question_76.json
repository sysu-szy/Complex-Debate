{"question": "The sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 153, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.7. What is the value of $y - x$?", "answer": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$.", "agents_response": "We can map the two provided equations from the problem as \nx + y = 153 and,\nx/y = 0.7 or, x = 0.7y\n\nReplacing x in first equation, we have 0.7y + y = 153 --> y = 153 / 1.7 = 90\nTherefore, x = 153 - 90 = 63\n\nSo, y - x = 90 - 63 = 27.\n\nTherefore, the value of y - x is \\boxed{27}."}
