{"question": "If $y=\\frac{27x^2+9x+3}{27x^3+9x^2+3x+1}$, at what value of $y$ will there be a horizontal asymptote?", "answer": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients of the highest degree terms of the numerator and denominator when the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. \n\nIn the given function $y=\\frac{27x^2+9x+3}{27x^3+9x^2+3x+1}$, the highest degree term in the numerator is $27x^2$ and in the denominator is $27x^3$. The ratio of the coefficients is $\\frac{27}{27} = 1$. \n\nSo, the value of $y$ at the horizontal asymptote is \\boxed{0}."}
