{"question": "The sum of four consecutive positive even integers is a perfect square. What is the least possible sum?", "answer": "Let $2n-2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$ be four consecutive positive even integers. If $(2n-2)+(2n)+(2n+2)+(2n+4)=8n+4=2^2(2n+1)=m^2$ for some positive integer $m$, then $2n+1$ must be an odd perfect square. $2n+1=1^2$ gives $n=0$, which we reject because our integers are positive. $2n+1=3^2$ gives $n=4$, which yields a sum of $8\\times4+4=36$. Thus, the least possible sum is $\\boxed{36}$.", "agents_response": "Let the four consecutive positive even integers be n, n+2, n+4, and n+6. According to the problem, the sum of these four numbers is a perfect square.\n\nThis leads to the equation: n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) = m^2, or 4n + 12 = m^2.\n\nFor simplicity sake, let's let m = 1. Solving for n, we get: 4n + 12 = 1, or 4n = -11. Since n cannot be negative (because it's a positive integer), we ignore this solution.\n\nLet's try m = 2. Solving for n, we get: 4n + 12 = 4, or 4n = -8. Again, this is not a valid solution because n is a positive integer.\n\nFinally, let's try m = 3. Solving for n, we get: 4n + 12 = 9, or 4n = -3. This is not a valid solution.\n\nLet's try m = 4. Solving for n, we get: 4n + 12 = 16, or 4n = 4. Dividing both sides by 4, we get n = 1. \n\nThis means the least possible sum is when n = 1. So the four numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7, and their sum is 16.\r\n\r\nSo, the least possible sum of four consecutive positive even integers that is a perfect square is \\boxed{16}."}
