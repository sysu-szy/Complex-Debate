{"question": "What is the remainder when $7438+7439+7440+7441+7442+7443+7444+7445$ is divided by $8$?", "answer": "Since $7438,7439,\\ldots,7445$ are $8$ consecutive integers, they include exactly one integer from each residue class $\\pmod 8$. Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod 8$ to $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod 8$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "Each of these numbers leaves the same remainder when divided by 8. Specifically, 7438 modulo 8 equals 6. Therefore, the sum of eight numbers each equivalent to 6 modulo 8 is equivalent to 0 modulo 8. So, the remainder when this sum is divided by 8 is \\boxed{0}."}
