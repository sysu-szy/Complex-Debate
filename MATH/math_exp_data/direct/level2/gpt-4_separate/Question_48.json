{"question": "Find the equation of the oblique asymptote of the graph of\n\\[y = \\frac{4x^2 - 10x + 7}{2x - 5}.\\]Enter your equation in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".", "answer": "We can write\n\\[y = \\frac{4x^2 - 10x + 7}{2x - 5} = \\frac{2x(2x - 5) + 7}{2x - 5} = 2x + \\frac{7}{2x - 5}.\\]Thus, the equation of the oblique asymptote is $\\boxed{y = 2x}.$", "agents_response": "To find the oblique asymptote of the graph of the rational function \\[y = \\frac{4x^2 - 10x + 7}{2x - 5},\\] we perform the polynomial division of the numerator by the denominator. \nIn the division, we ignore the remainder because as x approaches infinity, the remainder will have an insignificant effect on the value of y. \n\nThe polynomial division of \\[(4x^2 - 10x + 7)\\div(2x - 5)\\] yields \n\\[2x + 5.\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the oblique asymptote is \n\\[\\boxed{y = 2x + 5}.\\]"}
