{"question": "In triangle $ABC$, the measure of angle $A$ is $x$ degrees, the measure of angle $B$ is $2x$ degrees and the measure of angle $C$ is $5x$ degrees. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "answer": "The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we have the equation $x+2x+5x=180$, so $x=\\boxed{22.5}$.", "agents_response": "In a triangle, the sum of the measures of the angles is always $180$ degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$x + 2x + 5x = 180$\n\nThis simplifies to $8x = 180$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = 22.5$ degrees.\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{22.5}$."}
