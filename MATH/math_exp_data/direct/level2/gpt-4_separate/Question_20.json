{"question": "The distance between two cities on a map is 4 centimeters. If the scale is 0.5 cm:1 km, how many kilometers apart are the actual cities?", "answer": "We have the ratio $$0.5 \\text{ cm on the map} : 1 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 2, we have the equivalent ratio $$1 \\text{ cm on the map} : 2 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 4, we find the equivalent ratio$$4 \\text{ cm on the map} : 8 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{8}$ kilometers apart in reality.", "agents_response": "The distance between the two cities on the map corresponds to 4 centimeters. If 0.5 centimeters on the map represents 1 kilometer in reality, then 4 centimeters would represent 4 \u00f7 0.5 = 8 kilometers in reality.\n\nSo, the actual cities are 8 kilometers apart.\n\n\\boxed{8}."}
