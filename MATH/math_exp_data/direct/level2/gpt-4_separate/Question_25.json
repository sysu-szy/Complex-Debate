{"question": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then what remainder does $2n+1$ give when divided by 7?", "answer": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": "Given that $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can write $n=7k+3$ for some integer k.\n\nThen, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7.$\n\nSince 14k is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is therefore 7 which is equivalent to 0.\n\nSo, \\boxed{0}."}
