{"question": "In a class of 50 students, 28 participate in MATHCOUNTS, 21 participate in science club, and 6 students participate in neither. How many students participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club?", "answer": "Among the $50-6=44$ students that participate in either MATHCOUNTS or science club, $44-28=16$ students do not participate in MATHCOUNTS.  All 16 of these students only participate in science club.  The other $21-16=\\boxed{5}$ science club participants participate in MATHCOUNTS as well.", "agents_response": "The total number of students in the class is given as 50 students. The number of students that participate in MATHCOUNTS is 28, and the number that participate in Science club is 21. \n\nWe add these two quantities to get a total of 49 students who participate in either MATHCOUNTS or Science Club or both. This is in contrast with the 44 students who are stated to participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the Science Club or neither. The difference of 5 must therefore represent the students who participate in both activities.\n\nHence, there are \\boxed{5} students that participate in both MATHCOUNTS and Science club."}
