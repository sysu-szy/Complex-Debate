{"question": "The fair spinner shown is spun once. What is the probability of spinning an odd number? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\ndot((0,0));\n\ndraw((3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3));\nimport graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),25));\ndraw((0,-25)--(0,25));\ndraw((0,0)--(25,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(-15,9),Arrow);\nlabel(\"15\",(-10,0),W);\nlabel(\"23\",(10,10),NE);\nlabel(\"14\",(10,-10),SE);\n[/asy]", "answer": "The central angles of the two regions corresponding to odd numbers are 180 degrees and 90 degrees.  Therefore, the probability of spinning an odd number is $\\frac{180+90}{360}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.", "agents_response": "The spinner has 3 different numbers: 15, 23, and 14. 15 and 23 are the odd numbers. So there are 2 odd numbers and 3 total numbers. The probability of spinning an odd number is therefore $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}."}
