{"question": "Let $F$ be the first digit and $L$ be the last digit of the expanded integer form of $2007^3$. What is the value of $F + L$?", "answer": "We can rewrite $2007^3$ as the cube of a binomial: \\begin{align*}\n2007^3 &= (2\\cdot 10^3 + 7)^3\\\\\n&= \\binom{3}{0} (2\\cdot 10^3)^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{3}{3} 7^3\n\\end{align*}\n\nOnly the first and last term of the binomial expansion affect the values of $F$ and $L$. The first term is equal to $8\\cdot 10^9$, so $F = 8$. The last term is equal to 343, so $L = 3$. Therefore, $F + L = \\boxed{11}$.", "agents_response": "The cubic expansion of $2007^3$ equals to $8095083423$. The first digit $F$ is $8$ and the last digit $L$ is $3$. Therefore, $F + L = 8 + 3 = 11$.\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$."}
