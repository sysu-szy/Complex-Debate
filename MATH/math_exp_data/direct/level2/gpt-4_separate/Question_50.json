{"question": "Find the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$.", "answer": "$9 \\cdot 9 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 81 + 1 = 82$, so the units digit is $\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "The units digit of a product or sum depends only on the units digits of the numbers involved. In particular, the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79$ is the same as the units digit of $9 \\cdot 9$, which is 1. Similarly, the units digit of $31 \\cdot 81$ is the same as the units digit of $1 \\cdot 1$, which is 1. \n\nSo, the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$ is the same as the units digit of $1 + 1$, which is \\boxed{2}."}
