{"question": "The temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?", "answer": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "The temperature in the desert rises $1.5$ degrees every $15$ minutes. There are $4$ intervals of $15$ minutes in $1$ hour, so the temperature rises $4\\cdot1.5 = 6$ degrees every hour.\n\nTherefore, in $2$ hours, the temperature rises $6\\cdot2 = 12$ degrees.\n\nThus, the temperature will rise \\boxed{12} degrees in the next $2$ hours."}
