{"question": "Robert is doing his quadratics factoring worksheet when a drop of ink ruins part of his work.\n\nThe problem asks him to factor $-35-x+12 x^2$ and he has correctly figured out one of two factors: $(3x + 5).$ What must be the other factor?", "answer": "Given that we have $- 35 - x + 12x^2$ and the factor $3x + 5$, we can guess that the other factor must be $4x - 7$ since the linear terms must multiply to $12x^2$ and the constant terms must multiply to $-35.$\n\nExpanding, we can verify that this is correct, and therefore our answer is $\\boxed{(4x - 7)}.$", "agents_response": "The other factor can be determined by dividing the original polynomial by the known factor. So if we divide $(-35-x+12x^2)$ by $(3x+5)$ we can find the other factor.\n\nUsing polynomial division, we get $(-4x+7)$\n\nSo the other factor is $(-4x+7)$. Thus, the answer is \\boxed{-4x+7}."}
