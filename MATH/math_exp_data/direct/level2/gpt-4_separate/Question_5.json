{"question": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word GAMMAS.", "answer": "There are two A's, two M's, and six total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{180}$.", "agents_response": "The word 'GAMMAS' has 6 letters, of which 2 are 'M's and 2 are 'A's. We can arrange the 6 letters in 6! ways. However, this counts arrangements that differ only by the arrangement of the 'M's and 'A's separately. Since there are 2 'M's and 2 'A's, we have over-counted each arrangement by a factor of 2! * 2!. Therefore, the number of unique arrangements of the word 'GAMMAS' is 6! / (2! * 2!) = 180. \n\n\\boxed{180}"}
