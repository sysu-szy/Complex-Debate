{"question": "What is the smallest positive integer solution to $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$?", "answer": "The fraction's numerator is equal to $10^8$, or $100^4$.  Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find that $\\frac{100}{x} < 1$, meaning that $100<x$ (since $x$ is positive).  So $x = \\boxed{101}$ is the smallest positive integer solution.", "agents_response": "To find the smallest positive integer solution to $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$, we simply need to find an integer x such that $x^4 > 100,000,000$.\n\nWe start by simplifying $100,000,000 = (10^2)^4 = 10^8$. Then, we realize that $x^4 > 10^8$ means $x > 10^2 = 100$.\n\nHowever, we need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies this inequality, so we round up to the smallest integer larger than 100, which is 101. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{101}."}
