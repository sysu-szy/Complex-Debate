{"question": "How many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.", "answer": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi.\\] Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$ yields $r^2 = 49$; taking the square root of both sides and keeping the positive solution yields $r=7$ inches.\n\nA great circle of a sphere is the circular cross-section of the sphere that passes through the sphere's center, which, in this case, is a circle with radius 7.  The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches.", "agents_response": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $4\\pi r^2$. Thus, if the surface area of the sphere is $196\\pi$ square inches, we can set up the equation $4\\pi r^2=196\\pi$ and solve for $r$:\n\n\\begin{align*} \n4\\pi r^2 &= 196\\pi, \\\\\nr^2 &= \\frac{196\\pi}{4\\pi}, \\\\\nr^2 &= 49, \\\\\nr &= 7. \n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the radius of the sphere is 7 inches.  \n\nThe circumference of a great circle of a sphere (the largest possible circle that can be drawn on the sphere) is given by the formula $2\\pi r$. Thus, the circumference of the great circle of this sphere is $2\\pi(7)=\\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches."}
