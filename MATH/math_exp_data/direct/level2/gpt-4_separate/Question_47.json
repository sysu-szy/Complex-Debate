{"question": "What is the smallest positive integer solution to $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$?", "answer": "The fraction's numerator is equal to $10^8$, or $100^4$.  Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find that $\\frac{100}{x} < 1$, meaning that $100<x$ (since $x$ is positive).  So $x = \\boxed{101}$ is the smallest positive integer solution.", "agents_response": "We begin by solving the inequality $100,000,000 \\div x^4 < 1$. Multiplying both sides by $x^4$ gives $100,000,000 < x^4$. Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find $x > \\sqrt[4]{100,000,000}$. Now, $\\sqrt[4]{100,000,000} \\approx 178. Therefore, the smallest positive integer solution to the inequality is $\\boxed{179}$."}
