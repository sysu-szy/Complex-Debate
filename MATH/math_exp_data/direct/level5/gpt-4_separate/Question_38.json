{"question": "Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?", "answer": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.\n\nAll of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.  The only one of these that is divisible by 7 is 21, so there are $10- 1 =\\boxed{9}$ numbers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28.", "agents_response": "The numbers relatively prime to 28 are those that do not share any prime factors with 28. The prime factorization of 28 is 2, 2, and 7, so any numbers that are not multiples of 2 or 7 are relatively prime to 28.\n\nThus, we need to count the numbers between 10 and 30 that are not multiples of either 2 or 7. Multiples of 2 are 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28. That's 9 numbers.\n\nMultiples of 7 are 14, 21, 28. That's 3 numbers.\n\nHowever, we are double counting the numbers that are multiples of both 2 and 7, which are 14 and 28. Thus, there are 9 + 3 - 2 = 10 numbers between 10 and 30 that are not relatively prime to 28.\n\nWe also need to include the number 10 (which is a multiple of 2), and not include the number 30 (which is outside our range), so that gives us 11 numbers.\n\nThere are 19 numbers total between 10 and 30, so there must be 19 - 11 = \\boxed{8} numbers that are relatively prime to 28."}
