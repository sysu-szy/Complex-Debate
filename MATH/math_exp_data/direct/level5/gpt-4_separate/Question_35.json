{"question": "Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive divisors of $80.$ What is the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80?$", "answer": "The positive divisors of $80$ are $1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,40,80.$ As $80=2^4\\cdot 5$, the immediate possibilities for $ab$ that do not divide $80$ are $8\\cdot 4=16\\cdot 2=32$ and $5\\cdot 10=50.$ As $32<50,$ the smallest $ab$ not a divisor of $80$ is $\\boxed{32}.$", "agents_response": "The positive divisors of $80$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40$ and $80$. To find $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80$, we note that if $a$ and $b$ are divisors of $80$, then $ab$ is also a divisor of $80$ unless there exists a prime factor which appears in the prime factorization of $ab$ more times than in the prime factorization of $80$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $80$ is $2^4*5$. Therefore, a prime factor can appear at most $4$ times if it is $2$ and at most $1$ time if it is $5$ in the prime factorization of $ab$. Note that $2*2*2*5 = 40$ is a divisor of $80$. But, $2*2*2*2 = 2^4 = 16$ is not a divisor of $80$ because $2$ appears more times in the prime factorization of $16$ than in the prime factorization of $80$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80$ is $2^4 = 16$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{16}$."}
