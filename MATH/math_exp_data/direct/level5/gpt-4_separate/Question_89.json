{"question": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, and that $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$.  Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.", "answer": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 8, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 4 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^4$ or $b(g(x))^4$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^4$, which equals $ba_{n}^4x^{4n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 8, we have $4n=8$, so $n=2$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "The degree of $h(x)$ is 8 and the degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degree of $f(x)$ and the degree of $g(x)$ (since $f(g(x))$ can be viewed as a composition of functions). \n\nWe have, \n\n$\\text{deg}(h(x)) = \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) + \\text{deg}(g(x))$\n\n$\\text{deg}(f(x)) \\cdot \\text{deg}(g(x)) + \\text{deg}(g(x)) = \\text{deg}(h(x))$\n\nSince the degree of $f(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $h(x)$ is 8, we get,\n\n$4 \\cdot \\text{deg}(g(x)) + \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 8$\n\nSolving for $\\text{deg}(g(x))$, we get\n\n$\\text{deg}(g(x)) = \\frac{8}{5}$\n\nThis means that the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}$."}
