{"question": "If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)", "answer": "First, we factor $10!:$\n\\begin{align*} 10!&=10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\\\ &=2^8\\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7.\\end{align*}\nHence, $x$ can be $1, 2^1, 2^2, 3, 2^1\\cdot 3,\\text{ or }2^2\\cdot 3$ for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ possible values of $x.$", "agents_response": "We must find all x for which $x^3$ is a factor of $10!$ such that x is an integer. We know that $10! = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1$, which has prime factorization of $2^{8}*5^{2}*3^{4}*7^{1}$.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the number of cubed integers which divide $10!$. Cubed integers must have at least 3 of the same factor, and since $10!$ is made up of the prime factors $2$, $5$, $3$, and $7$, we can have the sets $(2,2,2)$, $(3,3,3)$, $(2,2,2,3,3,3)$, $(5,5,5)$, and $(7,7,7)$ as possible sets of factors for values of $x^3$. \n\nHowever, sets of prime factors in $10!$ that are greater than 3, like $2^{4}$ and $3^{4}$, can create additional possible values for $x$. For instance, for $2^{4}$ we can form the sets $(2,2,2)$ and $(2,2,2,2)$, and for $3^{4}$ we can form the sets $(3,3,3)$ and $(3,3,3,3)$. This means each of these can contribute two to the total number of possible values of $x$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of possible values of $x$ equals to 2 possible values from $2^{4}$, 2 possible values from $3^{4}$, and 1 possible value each from the sets $(5,5,5)$ and $(7,7,7)$ . \n \nSo, there are $\\boxed{6}$ possible integer values of $x$."}
