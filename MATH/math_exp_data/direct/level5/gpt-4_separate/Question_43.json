{"question": "An Internet service provider allows a certain number of free hours each month and then charges for each additional hour used. Wells, Ted, and Vino each have separate accounts. This month the total hours used by Wells and Ted was 105, and each used all of their free hours. Their total cost was $\\$10$. Vino used 105 hours by himself and had to pay $\\$26$. What is the number of cents charged for each extra hour?", "answer": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the number of free hours as x and the charge per extra hour as y (in dollars). We can form two equations based on the information provided.\n\nFrom the information on Wells and Ted, we can deduce that their total hours used exceed their total free hours. Considering the cost they incurred is $10, we have:\n\n105 - 2x = 10y ---- equation (1)\n\nFrom Vino's usage and cost, we deduce:\n\n105 - x = 26y --- equation (2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) simplifies to:\n\nx = 16y\n\nSubstituting this into equation (2), we have:\n\n105 - 16y = 26y\n\n42y = 105\n\nSo, the extra-hour charge in dollars, y = 105 / 42 = 2.5\n\nSince 1 dollar is 100 cents, the extra-hour charge in cents is 2.5 * 100 = 250 cents\n\nTherefore, the number of cents charged for each extra hour is \\boxed{250}."}
