{"question": "Let  \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nk(x) &\\text{if }x>2, \\\\\n2+(x-2)^2&\\text{if }x\\leq2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find the function $k(x)$ such that $f$ is its own inverse.", "answer": "We want to have that $f(f(x))=x$ for every $x.$ Since $f(f(2))=2,$ we know $f$ is its own inverse at $x=2,$ so we can restrict our attention to $x\\neq 2.$\n\nSince $f$ applied to any number less than $2$ returns a number greater than $2,$ and we can get all numbers greater than $2$ this way, applying $f$ to any number greater than $2$ must give a number less than $2.$ Therefore $k(x)<2$ for any $x>2.$\n\nIf $x>2$ and $f$ is its own inverse then \\[x=f(f(x))=f(k(x))=2+\\left(k(x)-2\\right)^2,\\]where in the last step we used that $k(x)<2.$ Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives \\[\\left(k(x) - 2\\right)^2 = x-2.\\]Next, we recall that we must have $k(x) < 2,$ so $k(x) - 2$ must be the negative number whose square is $x-2.$  That is, we have $k(x) - 2 = -\\sqrt{x-2}.$\n\nSolving this for $k(x)$ gives  \\[k(x)=\\boxed{-\\sqrt{x-2}+2}.\\]", "agents_response": "Since $f$ is its own inverse, we have $f(f(x)) = x$. So, we split this into cases.\n\nCase 1: $f(x) \\leq 2$.\n\nThen, $f(f(x)) = f(2 + (f(x) - 2)^2) = 2 + (2 + (f(x) - 2)^2 - 2)^2 = 2 + (f(x))^2 - 4f(x) + 4$.\n\nSetting this equal to $x$, we get $x = 2 + (f(x))^2 - 4f(x) + 4$, simplifying to $(f(x))^2 - 4f(x) = x - 6$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $f(x)$, so we can solve it for $f(x)$, getting $f(x) = 2 \\pm\\sqrt{x+2}$.\n\nHowever, since we are in case $1$, where $f(x) \\leq 2$, we have $f(x) = 2 - \\sqrt{x+2}$ (since $2 + \\sqrt{x+2} > 2$).\n\nThis equation will give us only $x \\geq -2$, since a negative argument for a square root operation does not yield a real number.\n\nSo now what is left, is to map the other case (Case 2: $x > 2$).\n\nIn this case, $f(f(x)) = f(k(x)) = k(k(x))$,\n\nSetting this equal to $x$, we get $x = k(k(x))$.\n\nNow, let's replace $k(x)$ in the above equation with $y, y = k(x), k(x) -> y$, thus we get $x = y(y)$.\n\nSo for $x > 2$, we have $x = y^2$ (since for $y > 2$, $y = \\sqrt{x}$).\n\nThus, we can find $k(x)$ as $k(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.\n\nSo the function $k(x)$ such that $f$ is its own inverse is $k(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. \n\nSo, \\boxed{k(x) = \\sqrt{x}}."}
