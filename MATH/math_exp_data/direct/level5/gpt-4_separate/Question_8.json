{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.", "agents_response": "First, we think about the product of the divisors of a number n. For all n>1, the divisors of n always include 1 and n. So the product of the divisors of n is always at least n, and in fact the product of the divisors is equal to n only in the case where n is prime and has exactly two divisors. \n\nNow if we want the product of the divisors to be $n^6$ , we start with $n^6 = 1 \\cdot n = n$ and realize that we are left with a product of $n^5$ to be covered by the other divisors of n. \n\nHow can we arrange these other divisors? We are trying to make the product of the divisors of n equal to $n^6$. All the divisors other than 1 and n should themselves be divisors of $n^5$. \n\nIf we look at $n = p^2$ for p prime, the divisors are 1, p, and $p^2$. The product is $p^4$, which is not enough. But if we look at $n = p^3$ for p prime, the divisors are 1, p, $p^2$, and $p^3$. The product is $p^6$, which is just what we want. \n\nSo the smallest such n is the cube of the smallest prime, which is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{8}."}
