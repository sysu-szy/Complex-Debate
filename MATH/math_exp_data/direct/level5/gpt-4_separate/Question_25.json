{"question": "Let $O$ be the origin, and let $OABC$ be a rectangle, where $A$ and $C$ lie on the parabola $y = x^2.$  Then vertex $B$ must lie on a fixed parabola.  Enter the equation of the fixed parabola in the form \"$y = px^2 + qx + r$\".", "answer": "Let $A = (a,a^2)$ and $C = (c,c^2).$  Since $\\overline{OA}$ and $\\overline{OC}$ are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is $-1$:\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{a} \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{c} = -1.\\]Thus, $ac = -1.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\npair A, B, C, O;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = (0.8,func(0.8));\nC = (-1/0.8,func(-1/0.8));\nB = A + C - O;\n\ndraw(graph(func,-1.6,1.6));\ndraw(O--A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndot(\"$A = (a,a^2)$\", A, SE);\ndot(\"$B$\", B, N);\ndot(\"$C = (c,c^2)$\", C, SW);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nAs a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide.  The midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is\n\\[\\left( \\frac{a + c}{2}, \\frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} \\right),\\]so $B = (a + c,a^2 + c^2).$\n\nLet $x = a + c$ and $y = a^2 + c^2.$  We want a relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the form of $y = px^2 + qx + r.$  We have that\n\\[x^2 = (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2 = y - 2,\\]so the fixed parabola is $\\boxed{y = x^2 + 2}.$", "agents_response": "We know that $y = x^2$ is a parabola whose vertex is at the origin. Therefore, we know the coordinates of point $A$ are $(a, a^2)$ and the coordinates of point $C$ are $(-a, a^2)$. Since $OABC$ is a rectangle, the coordinates of point $B$ are $(-a, 3a^2)$. \n\nLet $x=-a$ and $y=3a^2$ be the coordinates of point $B$. Therefore, we can rewrite this system as $a=-x$ and $a^2= \\frac{y}{3}$. Squaring the first equation gives us $a^2=x^2$, which we can equate to the second equation to solve for $y$ as follows:\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{y}{3}$\n$y=3x^2$\n\nSo the equation of the parabola on which $B$ lies is \\boxed{y = 3x^2}."}
