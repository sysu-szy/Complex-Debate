{"question": "A $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle is drawn on the exterior of an equilateral triangle so the hypotenuse of the right triangle is one side of the equilateral triangle. If the shorter leg of the right triangle is 6 units, what is the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw((2,0)--(0,0)--(1,1.732)--(2,1.732)--(2,0)--(1,1.732));\ndraw((2,1.632)--(1.9,1.632)--(1.9,1.732));\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(1,1.732),2SE+E);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\",(2,0),5NNW+4N);\nlabel(\"6\",(1.5,1.732),N);\n[/asy]", "answer": "Multiply the short leg of the right triangle by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find that the length of the longer leg is $6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  Double the short leg of the right triangle to find that the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 12 units.  Since the hypotenuse of the right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 12 units.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between the two vertices that the two triangles do not have in common is $\\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2+12^2}=\\sqrt{252}=\\boxed{6\\sqrt{7}}$ units. [asy]\ndraw((2,0)--(0,0)--(1,sqrt(3))--(2,sqrt(3))--(2,0)--(1,sqrt(3)));\ndraw((2,sqrt(3)-0.1)--(1.9,sqrt(3)-0.1)--(1.9,sqrt(3)));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,sqrt(3)));\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(1,sqrt(3)),2SE+E);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\",(2,0),5NNW+4N);\nlabel(\"6\",(1.5,sqrt(3)),N);\nlabel(\"$6\\sqrt{3}$\",(2,sqrt(3)/2),E);\nlabel(\"12\",(1.5,sqrt(3)/2),SW);\nlabel(\"12\",(1,0),S);\n[/asy]", "agents_response": "The hypotenuse of the right triangle is twice the length of the shorter leg, which is $2 \\cdot 6=12$ units. The side of the equilateral triangle is therefore 12 units long. The distance from any vertex of an equilateral triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the length of the side. So, the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common is the sum of the lengths of two such distances, or $2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3}/2) \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units."}
