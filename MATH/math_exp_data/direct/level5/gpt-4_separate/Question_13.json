{"question": "A shop sells 500 smartphones a week for $\\$450$ each. A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars?", "answer": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.", "agents_response": "We start by determining an equation for Revenue (R), which is equal to the price per smartphone (P) multiplied by the quantity sold (Q).\n\nCurrently, the price per smartphone is $450 and the weekly quantity sold is 500. According to the survey, for each decrement of $5 in the price, an extra 10 smartphones will be sold. This means that the price can be defined as $P = 450 - 5d$ and the quantity as $Q = 500 + 10d$, where d represents each decrement of $5 in the price.\n\nPlugging P and Q into our Revenue equation we get: $R = (450 - 5d) * (500 + 10d)$. \n\nWe can simplify this to $R = 225000 - 2500d + 50d^2$. \n\nThis is a quadratic equation and represents a parabola that opens upwards. The maximum revenue is located at the vertex of this parabola.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-b/(2a)$. In our equation, a = 50 and b = -2500. \n\nSo plug a and b into the equation: d = -(-2500)/(2*50) = 2500/100 = 25. \n\nRemember, d represents each decrement of $5 in the price. So, to find the price that will yield maximum revenue, we would need to subtract $5*25 from our original price of $450. \n\nCalculate: 450 - 5*25 = 450 - 125 = 325. \n\nThe price that will result in maximum revenue will be $\\boxed{325}$ dollars."}
