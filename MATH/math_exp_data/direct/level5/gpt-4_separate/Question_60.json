{"question": "What is the value of $b+c$ if $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$?", "answer": "When $x<-2$ or $x>3$, we have $x^2+bx+c>0$. That means that $x^2+bx+c=0$ at $x=-2$ and $x=3$. So, the parabola has roots at -2 and 3, giving us $(x+2)(x-3)=0$. We can now write $x^2+bx+c=(x+2)(x-3)=x^2-x-6$. Thus, $b=-1$, $c=-6$, and $b+c=-1+(-6)=\\boxed{-7}$.", "agents_response": "The inequality $x^2+bx+c>0$ is true exactly when $x$ is not a solution to the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$. The roots of the equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ are the x-values where the parabola $y=x^2+bx+c$ intersects the x-axis. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that these roots are $-2$ and $3$. Hence, by the property that the roots of a quadratic equation $x^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $x=[-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}]/2a$, we know that $-b+\\sqrt{b^2-4c}=4$ and $-b-\\sqrt{b^2-4c}=6$, because the two roots sum to $-b$ and their product is $c$.\n\nSolving these two equations in two variables, we find that $b=-4$ and $c=6$, and so $b+c=-4+6=\\boxed{2}$."}
