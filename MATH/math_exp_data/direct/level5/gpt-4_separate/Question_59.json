{"question": "Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?", "answer": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles.", "agents_response": "The total number of tiles, $n$, is the product of all the factors, without repetition. \n\nLet $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\u2026p_k^{a_k}$ be the canonical form of $n$. \n\nThe number of rectangles that can be formed ('rectangular figures') is given by the product of each exponent, increased by one, since we must also consider the number one. This is true because we can choose to use each factor 0 to the corresponding exponent times, then divide in half and round down since the orientation doesn't matter. \n\nSo in this case, we need to find the prime factorization such that the total number of factors divided by 2 (then rounded down) equals 10. \n\nIn this case, the least number is $2^5*3^4*5^2*7^2*11^2*13^2*17^1*19^1=2^5*3^4*5^2*7^2*11^2*13^2*17^1*19^1$. \n\nTo get the least number of tiles possible, it is best to arrange the primes in ascending order by their powers. \n\nTherefore, Emma could have $2^6*3^3$ (or $432$) tiles, because we had six 2s and three 3s to get the ten total factors. \n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{432}$."}
