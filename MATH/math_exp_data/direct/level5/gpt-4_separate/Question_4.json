{"question": "A number is doubled, then decreased by $13.7$.  The result is greater than $125.28$. What is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the desired integer. Then $2x-13.7>125.28$.  Adding $13.7$ to both sides gives $2x>138.98$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives $x>69.49$.  The smallest integer that is greater than $69.49$ is $\\boxed{70}$.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the unknown number as $x$. According to the problem, we have: \n\n$2x - 13.7 > 125.28$. \n\nIf we add $13.7$ to both sides of the inequality we get:\n\n$2x > 138.98$. \n\nDividing both sides by $2$ gives:\n\n$x > 69.49$. \n\nThe smallest integer that is larger than 69.49 is $70$.\n\nThus, the smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $\\boxed{70}$."}
