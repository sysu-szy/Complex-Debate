{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "If the error in the measurement of the momentum is halved, then conversely, the error in the measurement of the position must increase by two times in order to still satisfy Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Therefore, the increase in the error of the measurement of the position is 2 - 1 = 1 = 100%. \nSo, the minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by \\boxed{100\\%}."}
