{"question": "Jane has been growing two bacteria farms.\n\nBacteria farm Rod has a starting population of 2 bacteria, while Bacteria farm Sphere has a starting population of 8 bacteria.  However, Jane starts growing Rod five hours before she starts growing Sphere.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Jane checks her farms and finds that they have the exact same population. If the population of Rod doubles every hour, but the population of Sphere is quadrupled every hour, how many hours ago did she start growing Sphere?", "answer": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.", "agents_response": "First, let's analyze the population of Rod. Because it doubles every hour, in the five hours before Sphere starts to grow, Rod already had a population of $2 \\times 2^5 = 64$. From this point on, both Rod and Sphere have the same doubling/quadrupling rates, so whatever population Sphere started with, it would be the same as Rod at 8 p.m.\n\nBy the same logic, if both Sphere and Rod's population were the same at 8 p.m., it means Sphere also had 64 bacteria when it started growing (because it quadrupled its population every hour from then on until 8 p.m.). Since Sphere started with 8 bacteria, it needed $\\frac{64}{8}=8$ times to reach the same population as Rod. Therefore, the doubling time for Sphere's population is $\\log_4{8}=1.5$ hours.\n\nComparing the time Sphere took to reach 64 bacteria with the time Rod took, $5 - 1.5 = 3.5$ hours elapsed before Jane started growing Sphere. This means that Jane started growing Sphere \\boxed{3.5} hours ago."}
