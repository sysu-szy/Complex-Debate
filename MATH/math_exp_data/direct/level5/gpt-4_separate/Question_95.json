{"question": "Define $f(x)=\\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ and $g(x)=\\frac{-2}{x+1}$. Find the value of \\[g(f(g(f(\\dotsb g(f(12)) \\dotsb ))))\\]where the function $f$ is applied 8 times, and the function $g$ is applied 8 times, alternating between the two.", "answer": "Define a new function $h(x)$ so that $h(x)=g(f(x))$. Then  \\begin{align*}\nh(x) &= g\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}+1}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-2}{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}+\\frac{1-x}{1-x}}=\\frac{-2}{\\frac{2}{1-x}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-1}{\\frac{1}{1-x}}=-(1-x)=x-1.\n\\end{align*}Thus our desired value is equivalent to $8$ compositions of the function $h(x)$. For each composition we subtract $1$ from the input value, so for $8$ compositions we subtract a total of $8$ from the input value, which is $12$. So our answer is $12-8=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "Firstly, let's calculate a couple of iterations through $f$ and $g$ to see the pattern. \n\nStart with $f(12)$:\n\n\\[f(12)=\\frac{1+12}{1-12}=\\frac{13}{-11}=-\\frac{13}{11}\\]\n\nThen calculate $g(f(12))$:\n\n\\[g\\left(-\\frac{13}{11}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11}+1}=\\frac{-2}{-\\frac{2}{11}}=\\frac{11}{1}=11\\]\n\nRepeating the calculation for $f(g(f(12)))$:\n\n\\[f(11)=\\frac{1+11}{1-11}=\\frac{12}{-10}=-\\frac{6}{5}\\]\n\nThen calculate $g(f(g(f(12))))$:\n\n\\[g\\left(-\\frac{6}{5}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{-\\frac{6}{5}+1}=\\frac{-2}{-\\frac{1}{5}}=10\\]\n\nAt this point, we can see a pattern - every second step, we're just returning to 11 and 10. This means each pair of operations ($f(g())$ or $g(f())$) returns to the same number, and the total sequence of $f(g(f(g(\\dots f(g(x))))))$ will just cycle between 10 and 11 every two operations.\n\nSince we start from 12 and have to apply the operations 16 times in total (8 times of $f$ and 8 times of $g$), we end on the eighth cycle, which ends on the number \\[\\boxed{10}\\]"}
