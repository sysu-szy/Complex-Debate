{"question": "Suppose $x$ is a solution to $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. What is the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal?", "answer": "We rearrange our equation: $x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$. Then, we use the quadratic equation to solve for $x$: $$x = \\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-(4)(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{7\\pm 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$ The two possible values of $x$ are reciprocals of each other. Here's why: \\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{(7+3\\sqrt{5})/2} &= \\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{7-3\\sqrt{5}} \\\\\n&=\\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{7^2 - (3\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{2(7-3\\sqrt{5})}{4} = \\frac{7-3\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, our answer is $$\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{7}.$$\n\n- OR -\n\nWe want the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal. This is $$x + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x}.$$ We are given that $x^2 + 1 = 7x$. Therefore, our answer is $$\\frac{x^2+1}{x} = \\frac{7x}{x} = \\boxed{7}.$$", "agents_response": "The given equation can be rearranged to give: $x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is given by $-(-7)$ which simplifies to $7$. Therefore, the sum of $x$ and its reciprocal is $\\boxed{7}$."}
