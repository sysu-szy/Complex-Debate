{"question": "Let\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{-px - 3}{-qx + 3},\\]and let $g(x)$ be the inverse of $f(x).$  If $(7,-22)$ lies on both of the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x),$ then find $p + q.$", "answer": "If $(7,-22)$ lies on both $y = f(x)$ and the graph of its inverse, then $f(7) = -22$ and $f(-22) = 7.$  Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3} &= -22, \\\\\n\\frac{22p - 3}{22q + 3} &= 7.\n\\end{align*}Then $-7p - 3 = -22(-7q + 3) = 154q - 66$ and $22p - 3 = 7(22q + 3) = 154q + 21.$\nSolving, we find $p = 3$ and $q = \\frac{3}{11},$ so $p + q = 3 + \\frac{3}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{36}{11}}.$", "agents_response": "Since $(7,-22)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know $-22 = f(7) = \\frac{-7p-3}{-7q+3}$. Multiplying both sides by $-7q+3$ gives $66q - 66 = -7p - 3$. After simplifying, we get $66q = -7p + 69$.\n\nSince the point is also on the graph of $y=g(x)$, we know $7 = g(-22) = f^{-1}(-22)$. This means that when we replace $x$ with $-22$ in our inverse function, we get 7. Another way to find the inverse function is replacing $x$ with $y$ and $y$ with $x$ in the original function and solving for $y$. \n\nDoing so, we would get $y = \\frac{-px-3}{-qx+3}$ ,which simplifies to $-qx+3 = -pxy-3y$ and then further simplifies to $qx = pxy + 3y - 3$. Then when solve for $y$ gives $y=\\frac{qx+3}{px+3}$ \n\nSo $7 = \\frac{-22q+3}{-22p+3}$. Multiplying both sides by $-22p+3$ gives $-154p+21 = -22q+3$. After simplifying, we get $-154p = - 22q - 18$\n\nFrom these two equations, we can find values of $p$ and $q$. By multiplying second equation by $3$ we equalize constants $69$ and $-18*3=-54$ : $-462p = -66q -54$, which leads us to $p=\\frac{14q+9}{11}$ Upon plugging this value into first equation instead of $p$ we get $66q=7*\\frac{13q+9}{11} + 66$ => $q=-6$\nPlugging $q$ value into one of equations for $p$ gives $p = -2$. \n\nThus, the final answer is $p+q = (-2) + (-6) = -8$, answer: \\boxed{-8}."}
