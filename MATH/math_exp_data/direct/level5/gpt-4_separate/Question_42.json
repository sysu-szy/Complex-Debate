{"question": "An airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?", "answer": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$.", "agents_response": "We have an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 100 and the common difference is 100. We want to find n such that the sum of the first n terms is 12000.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula Sn = n/2 * (a + l) where Sn is the sum of the first n terms, n is number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nWe know Sn = 12000 and a = 100. We also know that the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by an = a + (n-1)d where d is the common difference. Since d=100, then l = an = 100 + 100(n-1) = 100n.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get 12000 = n/2 * (100 + 100n). Therefore, we have n^2 +  n - 240 = 0.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get (n - 15)(n + 16) = 0.\n\nThis gives n = 15 or n = -16. But n can't be negative, so we discard n = -16.\n\nThe plane will take \\boxed{15} seconds to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height."}
