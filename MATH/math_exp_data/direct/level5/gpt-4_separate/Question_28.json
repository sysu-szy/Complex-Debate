{"question": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?", "answer": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.", "agents_response": "The height of the target is 5 feet off the ground, so we set $h$ equal to 5 and solve for $t$. \n\nWe have the equation $5 = 10 - 23t - 10t^2$.\n\nAdd $23t$ to both sides and subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the $t$ terms:\n$0 = -10t^2 + 23t + 5$.\n\nTo make the equation easier to work with, divide all terms by -1:\n$0 = 10t^2 - 23t - 5$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $0 = at^2 + bt + c$, so we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$. The quadratic formula is $t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 10$, $b = -23$, and $c = -5$.\n\nPlug these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{(-23)^2 - 4(10)(-5)}}{2(10)}$\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{529 + 200}}{20}$\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{729}}{20}$\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm 27}{20}$.\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n$t = \\frac{23 + 27}{20} = \\frac{50}{20} = 2.5$ and $t = \\frac{23 - 27}{20} = \\frac{-4}{20} = -0.2$.\n\nHowever, time cannot be negative, so we discard the negative solution and the only valid solution is $t=2.5$ seconds.\n\nTherefore, the arrow must reach the target in \\boxed{2.5} seconds in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye."}
