{"question": "The point $P = (-1,0)$ lies on the ellipse $4x^2 + y^2 = 4.$  Let $Q$ be another point on this ellipse, and let $d$ be the maximum length of $\\overline{PQ}.$  Find $d^2.$", "answer": "Let $Q = (x,y).$  From the given information, $y^2 = 4 - 4x^2.$  Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nPQ^2 &= (x + 1)^2 + y^2 \\\\\n&= x^2 + 2x + 1 + 4 - 4x^2 \\\\\n&= -3x^2 + 2x + 5 \\\\\n&= -3 \\left( x - \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\frac{16}{3}.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = \\frac{1}{3},$ and $d^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}.$", "agents_response": "The equation of the ellipse is $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$, which can be rewritten as $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 1$. The major axis is along the y-axis and has length 4, while the minor axis along the x-axis has length 2.\n\nThe point P = (-1,0) lies on the minor axis. The maximum length of the line segment PQ is achieved when Q is one of the points at the either end of the major axis. These points are (0,-2) and (0,2).\n\nThe distance between P and either of these points can be calculated by using the distance formula, d = sqrt((x2-x1)\u00b2+(y2-y1)\u00b2). \n\nCalculating the distance between P = (-1,0) and Q = (0,2), we get:\n\nd\u00b2 = ((-1 - 0)\u00b2 + (0 - 2)\u00b2)\n\n= ((-1)\u00b2 + (-2)\u00b2)\n\n= (1 + 4)\n\n= 5\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of PQ squared is \\boxed{5}."}
