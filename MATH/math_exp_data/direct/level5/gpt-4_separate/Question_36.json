{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.", "agents_response": "The product of the positive divisors of n^n is known as the divisor function (denoted as d(n)) and is equal to n raised to the power of (number of divisors)/(2). Thus we need to solve (number of divisors of n)/2 = 6 for the smallest positive integer n. \n\nA positive integer p with prime factorization of $p_1^{a_1}*p_2^{a_2}*...*p_k^{a_k}$ has (a1+1)*(a2+2)*...*(ak+1) divisors.\n\nGiven n > 1, the smallest number n with 12 divisors (because we need (number of divisors of n)/2 = 6) is n = 2^1 * 3^2 (which gives us (1+1)*(2+1) = 6 divisors). \n\nThis means that the smallest n meeting the conditions above is n = 2*9 = 18. We can verify this with the divisor function where the product of the positive divisors of 18^6 = 18^12 which indeed confirms our solution.\n\nHence, the smallest positive integer n whose positive divisors have a product of n^6, for n>1, is \\boxed{18}."}
