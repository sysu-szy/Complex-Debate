{"question": "A 420-page book contains an average of 600 words per page, and Roslyn reads the book at the rate of 360 words per minute. How many hours did it take her to read the book? Express your answer as a mixed number.", "answer": "This book contains $420\\times 600 = 252000$ words. Roslyn reads at 360 words per minute, so it takes her $\\frac{252000}{360} = 700$ minutes to read the book. To find how many hours it took her, we divide by 60: $\\frac{700}{60} = \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "The total number of words in the book is 420*600 = 252000 words.\n\nThe total time it would take Roslyn to read the book is 252000 / 360 = 700 minutes.\n\nConvert 700 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 700/60 = 11 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert 40 minutes to fraction of an hour by doing: 40/60 = 2/3 hours.\n\nTherefore, it took Roslyn \\boxed{11\\frac{2}{3}} hours to read the book."}
