{"question": "A standard six-sided die was rolled 50 times, and the outcomes are shown in the table. What is the average of the 50 outcomes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nOutcome&$\\#$ of Occurrences\\\\\\hline\n1&14\\\\\\hline\n2&5\\\\\\hline\n3&9\\\\\\hline\n4&7\\\\\\hline\n5&7\\\\\\hline\n6&8\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}", "answer": "The total of the 50 outcomes is $(14 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 2) + (9 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 4) + (7 \\times 5) + (8 \\times 6) = 14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162.$ Dividing this by 50, we find that the average roll was $\\boxed{3.24}$.", "agents_response": "The sum of all the outcomes is $1*14 + 2*5 + 3*9 + 4*7 + 5*7 + 6*8 = 14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162$. \n\nThe average of the 50 outcomes is the sum of all the outcomes divided by the number of outcomes, which is $162/50 = 3.24$.\n\nSo, the average of the 50 outcomes is \\boxed{3.24}."}
