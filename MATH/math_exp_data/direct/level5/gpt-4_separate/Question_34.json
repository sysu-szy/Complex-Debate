{"question": "How many different positive integers divisible by 4 can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits? For example, 12 counts, but 512 does not.", "answer": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.", "agents_response": "Divisibility rule by 4 states that a number is divisible by 4 if the number represented by its last two digits is divisible by 4. For our case, the two-digit numbers that could be formed from 1, 2, 3, and 4, and are divisible by 4, are 12 and 24. When it comes to forming four-digit numbers, we have two fixed digits, and so 2 factorial ways of arranging the remaining numbers. This gives us 2*2 = 4 four-digit numbers. However, we can also form two-digit numbers as well. Therefore, we have an additional 2 ways. Hence, there would be 4 + 2 = 6 different positive integers divisible by 4 that can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits. We could list them as 124, 214, 421, 412, 12, and 24. \nSo, the answer is \\boxed{6}."}
