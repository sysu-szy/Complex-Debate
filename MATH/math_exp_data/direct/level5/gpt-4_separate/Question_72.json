{"question": "Eighty percent of the students in a class (group A) share $40\\%$ of the candy equally. The remaining $20\\%$ of the students (group B) share the other $60\\%$ of the candy equally. The ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A has to the amount of candy a student in group B has is equal to what common fraction?", "answer": "Suppose that there are $c$ pieces of candy total shared by $s$ students in the class. In group A, there are $.8 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.4 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.4c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.8s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $.5\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. In group B, there are $.2 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.6 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.6c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.2s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $3\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. The ratio between the pieces of candy per student in group A and that in group B is $\\frac{.5\\frac{c}{s}}{3\\frac{c}{s}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.", "agents_response": "A student in group A gets $\\frac{40}{80}=\\frac{1}{2}$ pieces of candy per student. \nA student in group B gets $\\frac{60}{20}=3$ pieces of candy per student.\nTherefore, the ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A has to the amount of candy a student in group B has is $\\frac{1/2}{3}=\\frac{1}{2} \\div 3=\\frac{1}{6}$ .\nSo, the common fraction is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}."}
