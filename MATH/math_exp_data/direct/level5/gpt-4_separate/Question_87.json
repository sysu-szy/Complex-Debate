{"question": "Our basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?", "answer": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.", "agents_response": "There are 10 players, and we need to choose 5 for the first team. This can be done in 10 choose 5 ways, which is calculated as 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 252 ways.\n\nHowever, this method counts each possible matchup twice (once when we pick a specific group as team 1 and once when we pick the same group as team 2), so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting.\n\nSo, the number of ways to divide the 10 players into two teams of 5, without restrictions, is 252 / 2 = 126 ways. \n\nSo, there are \\boxed{126} ways to divide the 10 players into two teams of 5."}
