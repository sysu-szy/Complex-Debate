{"question": "How many ways are there to answer a $10$-question true/false test, where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false?", "answer": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "There are 2 possible answers (true or false) for each of the 10 questions, and thus there are a total of 2^10 = 1024 possible ways to answer all 10 questions. \n\nHowever, we need to subtract the possibilities where less than 3 questions are answered with a false. These possibilities are: \n\n- All questions are answered with a true, which has 1 possibility.\n\n- 1 question is answered with a false and 9 with a true. There are 10 ways to choose which question is answered with a false. \n\n- 2 questions are answered with a false and 8 with a true. There are 10 choose 2 = 45 ways to choose which questions are answered with a false. \n\nSo, there are a total of 1 + 10 + 45 = 56 possible ways to answer the test with less than 3 questions answered with a false. \n\nTherefore, the number of ways to answer the test with at least 3 questions answered with a false is 1024 - 56 = \\boxed{968}."}
