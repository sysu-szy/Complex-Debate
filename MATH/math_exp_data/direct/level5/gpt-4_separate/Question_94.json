{"question": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?", "answer": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$", "agents_response": "The tennis player started with a win ratio of 0.500, which means she had won exactly half of her matches. Let's say this was W wins out of a total of 2W matches.\n\nDuring the weekend, she won 3 out of the 4 matches she played, bringing her total to W+3 wins out of a total of 2W+4 matches.\n\nHer win ratio at the end of the weekend being greater than 0.503 means that $\\frac{{W+3}}{{2W+4}} > 0.503$. Solving this inequality for W, you get W < 1492.5.\n\nSince W needs to be a whole number (you can't win half a match), the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend would've been 1492.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{1492}."}
