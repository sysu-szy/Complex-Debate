{"question": "Suppose $m$ is a two-digit positive integer such that $6^{-1}\\pmod m$ exists and $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$. What is $m$?", "answer": "We can multiply both sides of the congruence $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$ by $6$: $$\n\\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^{-1}}_1 \\equiv \\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^2}_{6^3} \\pmod m.\n$$Thus $6^3-1=215$ is a multiple of $m$. We know that $m$ has two digits. The only two-digit positive divisor of $215$ is $43$, so $m=\\boxed{43}$.", "agents_response": "Since $6^{-1} \\equiv 6^2 \\pmod m$, this means $1 \\equiv 6^3 \\pmod m$, or $m$ divides $6^3 - 1 = 215$.\nThe two-digit factors of 215 are 5 and 43. But $6^{-1}\\pmod{5}$ does not exist because 6 and 5 are not relatively prime. So, $m$ must be $\\boxed{43}$."}
