{"question": "The sum of two numbers is 15. Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number. What is the larger number?", "answer": "Let $y$ be the larger of the numbers.  Since the numbers sum to 15, the other number is $15-y$.   Since four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger, we have: \\begin{align*}\n4(15-y)&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n60-4y&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n120&=6y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20&=y.\n\\end{align*} The larger number is $\\boxed{20}$, which makes the smaller number -5. We can check that our answer is correct by plugging the values into the original problem. We get $-5+20=15$ and $4(-5)=2(20)-60$, which result in $15=15$ and $-20=-20$.", "agents_response": "Let the two numbers be x and y, such that x < y.\n\nGiven, \nx + y = 15  ....(1)\n\nAnd, \n4x = 2y - 60  ....(2)\n\nFrom Equation (2), we have y = 2x + 30\n\nSubstitute y in Equation (1) we get,\n\nx + 2x + 30 = 15\n\n3x = 15 - 30 = -15\n\nThus, x = -15 / 3 = -5\n\nSubstitute x = -5 in Equation (1) we get,\n\n-5 + y = 15\n\nthis gives y = 15 + 5 = 20\n\nThe larger number is 20.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{20}."}
