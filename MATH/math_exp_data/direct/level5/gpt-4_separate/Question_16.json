{"question": "Let $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$.  Find the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x)=f(f(x))$.", "answer": "There are two ways for $x$ to not be in the domain of $g$: it can not be in the domain of $f$, or it can be in the domain of $f$ but not in the domain of $f\\circ f$.  In the first case, the denominator of $f$ is zero, so\n$$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$$For the second case, we see that the denominator of $f(f(x))$ is $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3$.  If this is zero, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} = 3 \\implies x-3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x = 3+\\frac13 = \\frac{10}3.\\]This is greater than $3$, so the largest $x$ not in the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{\\tfrac{10}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "The original function $f(x)$ is undefined at $x = 3$, so immediately we know $x = 3$ is not in the domain of $f$. To find the value not in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we must find an $x$ such that $f(x) = 3$.\n\nSetting $\\frac{1}{x - 3}$ equal to 3 and solving for $x$ yields:\n\n$\\frac{1}{x - 3} = 3 \\Rightarrow x - 3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \\frac{10}{3}$.\n\nSo the domain of $f(f(x))$ is all real numbers except $3$ and $\\frac{10}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the largest x that is not in the domain of $g(x)=f(f(x))$ is \\boxed{3}."}
