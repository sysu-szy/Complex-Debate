{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum times the error in the measurement of a particle's position is a constant, given by Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. This means that if the error in the momentum is halved, then the error in the position has to double to keep the product constant. Doubling the error in position corresponds to an increase of $100\\%$. Therefore, the minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by \\boxed{100\\%}."}
