{"question": "Two standard six-faced dice are rolled. Jean wins if the product of the two numbers rolled is odd or a multiple of three, otherwise Allen wins. What is the probability that Jean wins? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "When two dice are rolled, there are 36 total outcomes. Let's compute the probability that Allen wins. Allen wins if the product of the two numbers is even and not a multiple of 3. In other words, Allen wins if the product is 2 $(1\\cdot2, 2\\cdot1)$, 4 $(1\\cdot4, 4\\cdot1, 2\\cdot2)$, 8 $(2\\cdot4, 4\\cdot2)$, 10 $(2\\cdot5, 5\\cdot2)$, 16 $(4\\cdot4)$, or 20 $(4\\cdot5, 5\\cdot4)$. Therefore, the probability that Allen wins is $\\frac{2+3+2+2+1+2}{36}=12/36=1/3$. Then, the probability that Jean wins is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "There are a total of 36 outcomes when two dice are rolled (since each die has 6 faces and you are rolling 2 dice). If the product is odd, both dice must have rolled odd numbers. There are 3 odd numbers on a die (1,3,5), so there are 3*3 = 9 outcomes where the product is odd. If the product is a multiple of three, then at least one die must have rolled a 3 or a 6. There are 11 such outcomes (1,3) (3,1) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3) (4,3) (3,4) (5,3) (3,5) (6,3) (3,6) and the reversed (3,6) (6,3) (3,2) (2,3) (3,3) (3,4) (4,3) (3,5) (5,3) (6,3) (3,6) plus (1,6) (6,1) (2,6) (6,2) (4,6) (6,4) (5,6) (6,5) (6,6) making another total of 20. However, we are double counting the cases when the product is odd and a multiple of 3. Those cases are (1,3) (3,1) (3,3) (1,3) (3,1) (3,3) + (1,6) (6,1). So there are 8 cases we are double counting total. This gives us a total of 9 + 20 - 8 = 21 winning outcomes. Therefore, the probability Jean wins is 21/36 = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}."}
