{"question": "Find the smallest positive integer that is greater than $1$ and relatively prime to the product of the first 20 positive integers.  Reminder: two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.", "answer": "Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no prime factors.  Therefore, the desired positive integer must not share any prime factors with the product of the first 20 positive integers.  So, every prime in the prime factorization of the desired positive integer is greater than 20, which means the smallest possible integer is $\\boxed{23}$.", "agents_response": "The smallest positive integer greater than 1 that is relatively prime to the product of the first 20 positive integers is \\boxed{21}. This is because 21 shares no common prime factors with any number from 1 to 20, since its prime factors are 3 and 7."}
