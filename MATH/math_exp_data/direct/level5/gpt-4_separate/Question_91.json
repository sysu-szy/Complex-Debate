{"question": "In the circle with center $Q$, radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ form a right angle. The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles, as shown. The radius of the circle with center $Q$ is 14 inches. What is the radius of the smaller semicircle? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "Let $C$ and $D$ be the centers of the larger and smaller semicircles, respectively, and let $r$ be the radius of the smaller semicircle.  We have $QD=QB-DB=14-r$ and $QC=7$, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $QCD$ to obtain  \\[\n(14-r)^2+7^2=(7+r)^2.\n\\] After squaring both binomials and subtracting $7^2+r^2$ from both sides simplifies to $196-28r=14r$.  Adding $28r$ to both sides and dividing by 42, we find $r=\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$ inches.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\ndraw((1,0)..(0,1)..(-1,0)..(0,-1)..cycle);\ndraw((-1,0)--(0,0)--(0,-1));\ndraw((0,0)..(-.5,-.5)..(-1,0));\ndraw((0,-1)..(-1/3,-2/3)..(0,-1/3));\ndraw((-1/2,0)--(0,-2/3));\nlabel(\"$Q$\",(0,0),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-1,0),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,-1),S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-1/2,0),N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,-2/3),E);\ndot((-1/2,0));\ndot((0,-2/3));\nlabel(\"$7$\",(-7/20,-1/5),E);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-1/10,-8/15),SW);[/asy]", "agents_response": "The diagram for the problem shows a quarter of a large circle with two semicircles inscribed in it. The large circle has a radius of 14 inches. \n\nSince the large circle's radii form a right angle, the quarter of the circle wherein the two semicircles are inscribed forms a square if extended. \n\nThe diagonal of that square is the diameter of the large circle, which is 2*14 = 28 inches. \n\nSince the dimension of the diagonal of a square s with side length a is given by s = a\u221a2, we can find the side length a by rearranging the equation to a = s/\u221a2. \n\nSubstitute s with 28 inches (the diagonal length), we get a = 28/\u221a2 = 14\u221a2 inches. \n\nThe two smaller semi circles fill this square exactly, so the total diameter of both semi circles (which is equal to the length of a side of the square) is therefore 14\u221a2 inches. \n\nEach semi-circle thus has a radius half of that, so the radius of a smaller semicircle = (14\u221a2)/2 = 7\u221a2 inches.\n\nThus, the radius of the smaller semicircle is \\boxed{7\\sqrt{2}} inches."}
