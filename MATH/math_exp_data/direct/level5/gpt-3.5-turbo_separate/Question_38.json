{"question": "Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?", "answer": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.\n\nAll of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.  The only one of these that is divisible by 7 is 21, so there are $10- 1 =\\boxed{9}$ numbers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28.", "agents_response": "To find the integers that are relatively prime with 28 between 10 and 30, we need to find integers that do not have any common factors with 28 other than 1.\n\nThe prime factorization of 28 is 2^2 * 7. So, any number relatively prime to 28 must not have 2 or 7 as factors.\n\nThe integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.\n\nAfter checking for common factors, we find that 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27 are relatively prime to 28.\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{9} integers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28."}
