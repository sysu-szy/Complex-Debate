{"question": "Paula invests $\\$10,\\!000$ at the start of a 5 year period at an interest rate of $10\\%$. At the end of those 5 years, how much is her investment worth if the interest is compounded quarterly?  Express your answer rounded to the nearest cent.", "answer": "In the first quarter, Paula earns $\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000)$ in interest, so her investment is worth $\\$10,\\!000 +\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000) = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)(\\$10,\\!000)$. Similarly, the value of her investment is multiplied by $1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}$ each quarter, so after 5 years, which is $5\\cdot 4 = 20$ quarters, her investment is worth \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{5\\cdot 4}(\\$10,\\!000) \\approx \\boxed{\\$16,\\!386.16}.\\]", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\n\\[A = P \\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\]\n\nWhere:\n$A$ = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n$P$ = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)\n$r$ = the annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n$n$ = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\n$t$ = the number of years the money is invested.\n\nGiven:\n$P = \\$10,\\!000$\n$r = 10\\% = 0.10$\n$n = 4$ (quarterly compounding)\n$t = 5$ years\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[A = 10000 \\left(1+\\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4*5}\\]\n\\[A = 10000 \\left(1+0.025\\right)^{20}\\]\n\\[A = 10000 \\left(1.025\\right)^{20}\\]\n\\[A = 10000 * 1.282037...\\]\n\\[A = 12820.37...\\]\n\nRounded to the nearest cent, the investment is worth $\\boxed{\\$12,\\!820.37}$ at the end of the 5 years."}
