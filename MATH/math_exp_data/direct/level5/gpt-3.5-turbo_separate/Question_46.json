{"question": "Find the sum of all integers that satisfy these conditions: \\[\n|x|+1>7\\text{ and }|x+1|\\le7.\n\\]", "answer": "First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.\n\nNext, we consider $|x+1| \\le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \\le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.\n\nThe only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\\boxed{-15}$.", "agents_response": "The first inequality requires that $|x| > 6$, which means $x<-6$ or $x>6$. \nThe second inequality requires that $-7 \\le x+1 \\le 7$, which means $-8 \\le x \\le 6$. \n\nPutting these together, the integers that satisfy both conditions are $x = -7, -6, -5, 6$ and $7$. \n\nSumming these integers together, we get $-7 + (-6) + (-5) + 6 + 7 = -15 + 13 = -2$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-2}\\)."}
