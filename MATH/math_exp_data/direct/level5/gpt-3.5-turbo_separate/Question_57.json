{"question": "Let  \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nk(x) &\\text{if }x>2, \\\\\n2+(x-2)^2&\\text{if }x\\leq2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find the function $k(x)$ such that $f$ is its own inverse.", "answer": "We want to have that $f(f(x))=x$ for every $x.$ Since $f(f(2))=2,$ we know $f$ is its own inverse at $x=2,$ so we can restrict our attention to $x\\neq 2.$\n\nSince $f$ applied to any number less than $2$ returns a number greater than $2,$ and we can get all numbers greater than $2$ this way, applying $f$ to any number greater than $2$ must give a number less than $2.$ Therefore $k(x)<2$ for any $x>2.$\n\nIf $x>2$ and $f$ is its own inverse then \\[x=f(f(x))=f(k(x))=2+\\left(k(x)-2\\right)^2,\\]where in the last step we used that $k(x)<2.$ Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives \\[\\left(k(x) - 2\\right)^2 = x-2.\\]Next, we recall that we must have $k(x) < 2,$ so $k(x) - 2$ must be the negative number whose square is $x-2.$  That is, we have $k(x) - 2 = -\\sqrt{x-2}.$\n\nSolving this for $k(x)$ gives  \\[k(x)=\\boxed{-\\sqrt{x-2}+2}.\\]", "agents_response": "To find the inverse of a function, we typically swap the $x$ and $y$ variables and solve for $y$. However, since this function is defined piecewise, we need to find the inverse of each piece separately and then patch them together.\n\nFor $x>2$:\nLet $y = k(x)$, then $x = k(y)$. Since $x > 2$, this means $y > 2$. Therefore, $k(y) = x \\Rightarrow k(x) = y$. So $k(x)$ is its own inverse when $x>2$.\n\nFor $x\\leq 2$:\nLet $y = 2+(x-2)^2$. Swap the $x$ and $y$ variables: $x = 2 + (y-2)^2$. We can solve this for $y$:\n$x = 2 + (y-2)^2 \\\\\nx - 2 = (y-2)^2 \\\\\n\\sqrt{x-2} = y - 2 \\\\\ny = \\sqrt{x-2} + 2$\n\nTherefore, the inverse function of $f(x)$ is:\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nk(x) & \\text{if } x>2, \\\\\n\\sqrt{x-2} + 2 & \\text{if } x\\leq2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSince $k(x)$ is its own inverse for $x > 2$, we have $k(x) = x \\Rightarrow \\boxed{k(x) = x}$."}
