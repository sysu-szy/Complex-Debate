{"question": "Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive divisors of $80.$ What is the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80?$", "answer": "The positive divisors of $80$ are $1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,40,80.$ As $80=2^4\\cdot 5$, the immediate possibilities for $ab$ that do not divide $80$ are $8\\cdot 4=16\\cdot 2=32$ and $5\\cdot 10=50.$ As $32<50,$ the smallest $ab$ not a divisor of $80$ is $\\boxed{32}.$", "agents_response": "The prime factorization of $80$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5.$\nThe possible values for $a$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40.$\nThe possible values for $b$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40.$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $ab$ that is not a divisor of $80,$ we need to find two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the list above such that $a \\neq b$ and $ab$ is not divisible by $80.$\n\nObserving the divisors of $80,$ we see that $ab$ will be a multiple of $80$ if either $a$ or $b$ contains the factor of $5.$\n\nTo avoid this, we take $a = 2$ and $b = 4,$ then $ab = 8$ is not a divisor of $80.$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80$ is $\\boxed{8}.$"}
