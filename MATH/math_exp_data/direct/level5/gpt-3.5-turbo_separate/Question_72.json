{"question": "Eighty percent of the students in a class (group A) share $40\\%$ of the candy equally. The remaining $20\\%$ of the students (group B) share the other $60\\%$ of the candy equally. The ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A has to the amount of candy a student in group B has is equal to what common fraction?", "answer": "Suppose that there are $c$ pieces of candy total shared by $s$ students in the class. In group A, there are $.8 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.4 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.4c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.8s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $.5\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. In group B, there are $.2 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.6 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.6c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.2s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $3\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. The ratio between the pieces of candy per student in group A and that in group B is $\\frac{.5\\frac{c}{s}}{3\\frac{c}{s}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.", "agents_response": "Let the total number of students in the class be $100$. \n$80$ students are in group A and $20$ students are in group B. \nAmount of candy shared by group A = $40\\%$ of total candy = $\\frac{40}{100} \\times 100 = 40$\nEach student in group A gets $\\frac{40}{80} = \\frac{1}{2}$ amount of candy.\nAmount of candy shared by group B = $60\\%$ of total candy = $\\frac{60}{100} \\times 100 = 60$\nEach student in group B gets $\\frac{60}{20} = 3$ amount of candy.\nRatio of candy of group A to group B $= \\frac{1/2}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nTherefore, the common fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."}
