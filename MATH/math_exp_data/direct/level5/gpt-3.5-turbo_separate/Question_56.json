{"question": "Three mutually tangent spheres of radius 1 rest on a horizontal plane.  A sphere of radius 2 rests on them.  What is the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere?", "answer": "Let $A,B,C$ and $E$ be  the centers of the three small spheres and the large sphere, respectively. Then $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral with side length 2. If $D$ is the intersection of the medians of $\\triangle ABC$, then $E$ is directly above $D$. Because $AE=3$ and $AD=2\\sqrt{3}/3$, it follows that \\[\nDE= \\sqrt{3^{2}-\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}}= \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3}.\n\\]Because $D$ is 1 unit above the plane and the top of the larger sphere is 2 units above $E$, the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is \\[\n\\boxed{3+ \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3}}.\n\\][asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(10,0);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(5,8.7);\nD=(5,2.9);\ndraw(Circle(A,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle(B,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle(C,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--D--B,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(D--A,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(7.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(10,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(5,8.7),N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(3,4),S);\n[/asy]", "agents_response": "The distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere can be found by considering a right triangle formed by the center of the larger sphere, the point of contact between the larger sphere and one of the smaller spheres, and the center of one of the smaller spheres. \n\nLet the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere be x. The radius of the larger sphere is 2, and the radius of the smaller sphere is 1. Therefore, the distance from the center of the larger sphere to the point of contact between the larger sphere and one of the smaller spheres is 2-1=1. \n\nNow, consider the right triangle formed by the center of the larger sphere, the point of contact, and the center of one of the smaller spheres. This right triangle has legs of length 1 and x, and hypotenuse of length 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n1^2 + x^2 = 2^2\n1 + x^2 = 4\nx^2 = 3\nx = sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is sqrt(3).\n\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}"}
