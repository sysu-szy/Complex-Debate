{"question": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?", "answer": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.", "agents_response": "To hit the bulls eye, the height of the arrow must be equal to the height of the target, which is 5 feet off the ground. \n\nTherefore, we set $h=5$ and solve for $t$:\n$5=10-23t-10t^2$\n$0=5-23t-10t^2$\n$10t^2+23t-5=0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n$t=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nPlugging in $a=10, b=23, c=-5$:\n$t=\\frac{-23\\pm\\sqrt{23^2-4(10)(-5)}}{2(10)}$\n$t=\\frac{-23\\pm\\sqrt{529+200}}{20}$\n$t=\\frac{-23\\pm\\sqrt{729}}{20}$\n$t=\\frac{-23\\pm27}{20}$\n\nTherefore, $t=\\frac{4}{20}=0.2$ or $t=\\frac{-50}{20}=-2.5$\n\nSince time cannot be negative, the arrow must reach the target in $\\boxed{0.2}$ seconds in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye."}
