{"question": "The point $P = (-1,0)$ lies on the ellipse $4x^2 + y^2 = 4.$  Let $Q$ be another point on this ellipse, and let $d$ be the maximum length of $\\overline{PQ}.$  Find $d^2.$", "answer": "Let $Q = (x,y).$  From the given information, $y^2 = 4 - 4x^2.$  Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nPQ^2 &= (x + 1)^2 + y^2 \\\\\n&= x^2 + 2x + 1 + 4 - 4x^2 \\\\\n&= -3x^2 + 2x + 5 \\\\\n&= -3 \\left( x - \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\frac{16}{3}.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = \\frac{1}{3},$ and $d^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}.$", "agents_response": "The equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{x^2}{1^2} + \\frac{y^2}{2^2} = 1$, which means the ellipse has semi-major axis length 1 and semi-minor axis length 2.\n\nSince one focus of any ellipse is the center of the ellipse, we have the center of the ellipse at the origin. And since the ellipse is symmetric about the x-axis, the focus above the origin must be $(0,2)$.\n\nLet $Q = (a,b)$ be the point on the ellipse such that the distance between $P$ and $Q$ is maximized. The distance between points $P$ and $Q$ is given by $\\sqrt{(a+1)^2+(b-0)^2}$.\n\nUsing distance formula and the equation of ellipse, we can find $b$ in terms of $a$:\n\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{(a+1)^2+b^2} &= d \\\\ \\sqrt{(a+1)^2+\\frac{(2^2)(3^2)(1^2-a^2)}{4^2}} &= d \\\\ \\sqrt{(a+1)^2+\\frac{9(4-a^2)}{4}} &= d \\end{align*}\n\nTo maximize $d$, we can maximize $d^2$, i.e., \\[d^2 = (a+1)^2+\\frac{9(4-a^2)}{4} \\]\n\nMaximizing $d^2$ is equivalent to finding the maximum of $d^2-9$, which is \\[\\left( a+1 - \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2\\] =~ \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $d^2$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n$\\boxed{d^2 = \\frac{1}{4}}$"}
