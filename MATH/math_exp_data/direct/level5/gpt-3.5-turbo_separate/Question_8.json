{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.", "agents_response": "Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2,...,p_k$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nThe product of the positive divisors of $n$ is given by $(1+p_1+p_1^2+...+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+...+p_2^{a_2})...(1+p_k+p_k^2+...+p_k^{a_k})$.\n\nThis is equivalent to $\\left(\\dfrac{p_1^{a_1+1}-1}{p_1-1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{p_2^{a_2+1}-1}{p_2-1}\\right) \\cdot ... \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{p_k^{a_k+1}-1}{p_k-1}\\right)$.\n\nGiven that this product is equal to $n^6 = (p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k})^6 = p_1^{6a_1}p_2^{6a_2}...p_k^{6a_k}$.\n\nSince each of the terms on the right contains a factor of $p_i^{6}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, we equate the exponents on both sides for each prime factor. This gives:\n\n$6a_1 = a_1 + 1 \\Rightarrow a_1 = 1$\n$6a_2 = a_2 + 1 \\Rightarrow a_2 = \\frac{1}{5}$\n, . . . \n$6a_k = a_k + 1 \\Rightarrow a_k = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nHowever, since $n > 1$, all exponents $a_i$ must be integers, which implies that $a_2 = a_3 = ... = a_k = 1$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $n$ has prime factorization of the form $n = p_1p_2p_3$ where $p_1, p_2, p_3$ are distinct primes.\n\nThe smallest such $n$ is $n = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 30$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{30}$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$."}
