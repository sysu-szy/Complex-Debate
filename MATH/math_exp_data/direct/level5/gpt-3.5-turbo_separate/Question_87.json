{"question": "Our basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?", "answer": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.", "agents_response": "Since only the composition of the teams matters and not the order of the players within each team, this is a combination problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 players out of 10 to form a team is given by the combination formula:\n$\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 252$.\n\nTherefore, there are 252 ways to divide the basketball team into two teams of 5 players each.\n\\boxed{252}"}
