{"question": "A 420-page book contains an average of 600 words per page, and Roslyn reads the book at the rate of 360 words per minute. How many hours did it take her to read the book? Express your answer as a mixed number.", "answer": "This book contains $420\\times 600 = 252000$ words. Roslyn reads at 360 words per minute, so it takes her $\\frac{252000}{360} = 700$ minutes to read the book. To find how many hours it took her, we divide by 60: $\\frac{700}{60} = \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the total number of words in the book, we multiply the number of pages by the average number of words per page:\n420 pages * 600 words/page = 252,000 words\n\nNext, we divide the total number of words by Roslyn's reading rate to find the total time it took for her to read the book in minutes:\n252,000 words / 360 words/minute = 700 minutes\n\nFinally, we convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60:\n700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 11 hours and 40 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took Roslyn \\boxed{11\\frac{40}{60}} hours to read the book."}
