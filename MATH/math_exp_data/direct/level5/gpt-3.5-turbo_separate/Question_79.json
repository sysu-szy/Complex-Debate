{"question": "A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 40$), then the number of books sold per month is $120-3p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?", "answer": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or\n\\[p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.\\]We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-3(p-20)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=20$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book.", "agents_response": "The revenue for selling $p$ books at a price of $p$ dollars each is given by $p(120-3p) = 120p - 3p^2$. To maximize revenue, we need to find the maximum value of this quadratic function.\n\nTo find the maximum value, we can take the derivative of the revenue function and set it equal to zero:\n$\\frac{d}{dp}(120p - 3p^2) = 120 - 6p = 0$\n$6p = 120$\n$p = 20$\n\nTherefore, the store should charge $20 for the book to maximize its revenue.\n\n\\boxed{2400}"}
