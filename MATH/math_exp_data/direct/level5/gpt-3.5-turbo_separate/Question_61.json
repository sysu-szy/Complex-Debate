{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "Let $x$ be the original error in the measurement of the momentum, and let $y$ be the original error in the measurement of the position.\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we have:\n$$x \\cdot y \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$$\n\nAfter halving the error in the measurement of the momentum, the new error in the measurement of the momentum becomes $\\frac{x}{2}$. Let $z$ be the new error in the measurement of the position.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$\\frac{x}{2} \\cdot z \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$$\n\nWe want to find the percentage increase in the new error in the measurement of the position compared to the original error, which is given by:\n$$\\frac{z-y}{y} \\cdot 100 \\%$$\n\nRearranging our inequality, we get:\n$$z \\geq \\frac{h}{2\\pi x}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the values into our percentage increase formula to get:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{h}{2\\pi x}-y}{y} \\cdot 100 \\% = \\frac{h}{2\\pi x y} - 1$$\n\nSubstitute $x \\cdot y = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$:\n$$\\frac{h}{2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{h}{4\\pi}} - 1 = \\frac{2}{2} - 1 = \\boxed{0}$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position increases by 0%."}
