{"question": "Find the cubic polynomial, in $x,$ with integer coefficients that has $\\cos 20^\\circ$ as a root.  The coefficient of $x^3$ should be positive, and the coefficients should have no common factor other than 1.", "answer": "By the triple angle formula,\n\\[\\cos 3x = 4 \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x.\\]Setting $x = 20^\\circ,$ we get\n\\[\\cos 60^\\circ = 4 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 3 \\cos 20^\\circ,\\]so $4 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 3 \\cos 20^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2},$ or $8 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 6 \\cos 20^\\circ - 1 = 0.$  Thus, $x = \\cos 20^\\circ$ is a root of $\\boxed{8x^3 - 6x - 1}.$", "agents_response": "The cubic polynomial with $\\cos 20^\\circ$ as a root can be formed by using the fact that $\\cos 20^\\circ$ is a root of $4x^3 - 3x - \\cos 60^\\circ = 0.$ Note that $4\\cos 60^\\circ = 2,$ so $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}.$ Therefore, this polynomial is equivalent to $4x^3 - 3x - \\frac{1}{2} = 0,$ or $\\boxed{8x^3 - 6x - 1} = 0.$"}
