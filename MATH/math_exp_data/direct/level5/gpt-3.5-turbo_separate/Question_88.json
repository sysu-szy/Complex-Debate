{"question": "How many ways are there to answer a $10$-question true/false test, where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false?", "answer": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "We can count the total number of ways to answer the test and then subtract the number of ways to have $0$, $1$, or $2$ false answers.\n\nThere are $2^{10}$ total ways to answer the test (since each question has $2$ choices, true or false).\n\nTo find the number of ways to have $0$, $1$, or $2$ false answers, we can individually count the ways and then subtract from the total:\n\n- $0$ false answers: There is only $1$ way to answer all questions with true. ${10 \\choose 0} = 1$ way.\n- $1$ false answer: There are $10$ ways to choose which question is false, and the rest must be true. ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$ ways.\n- $2$ false answers: There are ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ ways to choose $2$ questions to be false, and the remaining $8$ must be true.\n\nSo, there are $1 + 10 + 45 = 56$ ways to have $0$, $1$, or $2$ false answers.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to answer the test with at least $3$ false answers is $2^{10} - 56 = \\boxed{968}$."}
