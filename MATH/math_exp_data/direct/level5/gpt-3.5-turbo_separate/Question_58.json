{"question": "The sum of two numbers is 15. Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number. What is the larger number?", "answer": "Let $y$ be the larger of the numbers.  Since the numbers sum to 15, the other number is $15-y$.   Since four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger, we have: \\begin{align*}\n4(15-y)&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n60-4y&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n120&=6y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20&=y.\n\\end{align*} The larger number is $\\boxed{20}$, which makes the smaller number -5. We can check that our answer is correct by plugging the values into the original problem. We get $-5+20=15$ and $4(-5)=2(20)-60$, which result in $15=15$ and $-20=-20$.", "agents_response": "Let's assume the two numbers are x and y, where x is the smaller number and y is the larger number.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\nx + y = 15  [equation 1]\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\n4x = 2y - 60\n=> 2x = y - 30\n=> 2x - y = -30  [equation 2]\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations by either substitution or elimination method. Let's go with elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2:\n2x + 2y = 30  [equation 3]\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n2x + 2y - (2x - y) = 30 - (-30)\n=> 3y = 60\n=> y = 20  \n\nTherefore, the larger number is \\boxed{20}."}
