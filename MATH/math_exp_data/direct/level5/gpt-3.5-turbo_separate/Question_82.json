{"question": "Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.", "answer": "Let the roots be $r$ and $s$ (not necessarily real).  We take the cases where $r = s$ and $r \\neq s.$\n\nCase 1: $r = s.$\n\nSince $r$ is the only root, we must have $r^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 2)(r + 1) = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$  This leads to the quadratics $x^2 - 4x + 4$ and $x^2 + 2x + 1.$\n\nCase 2: $r \\neq s.$\n\nEach of $r^2 - 2$ and $s^2 - 2$ must be equal to $r$ or $s.$  We have three cases:\n\n(i) $r^2 - 2 = r$ and $s^2 - 2 = s.$\n\n(ii) $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$\n\n(iii) $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r$.\n\nIn case (i), as seen from Case $r,$ $s \\in \\{2,-1\\}.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2.$\n\nIn case (ii), $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$  Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[r^2 - s^2 = s - r.\\]Then $(r - s)(r + s) = s - r.$  Since $r - s \\neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $r - s,$ to get $r + s = -1.$  Adding the equations $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r,$ we get\n\\[r^2 + s^2 - 4 = r + s = -1,\\]so $r^2 + s^2 = 3.$  Squaring the equation $r + s = -1,$ we get $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 1,$ so $2rs = -2,$ or $rs = -1.$  Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $x^2 + x - 1.$\n\nIn case (iii), $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$\n\nIf $r = 2,$ then $s^2 = 4,$ so $s = -2.$  (We are assuming that $r \\neq s.$)  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4.$\n\nIf $r = -1$, then $s^2 = 1,$ so $s = 1.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1.$\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{6}$ quadratic equations that work, namely $x^2 - 4x + 4,$ $x^2 + 2x + 1,$ $x^2 - x - 2,$ $x^2 + x - 1,$ $x^2 - 4,$ and $x^2 - 1.$", "agents_response": "Let $c$ be a root of $x^2 + ax + b = 0$. Then we have $c^2 + ac + b = 0$. \n\nWe are given that $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation, so substituting this into the equation, we get $(c^2 - 2)^2 + a(c^2 - 2) + b = 0$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying gives $c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 + ac^2 - 2a + b = 0$, which rearranges to $c^4 + (a-4)c^2 + (b-2a+4) = 0$.\n\nSince $c$ is a root of both equations, the coefficients of $c^2$ must be equal. Thus, we have $a - 4 = a$, which implies $a = -2$.\n\nSince the constant term must also be equal, we have $b - 2a + 4 = b$, which implies $b = -8$.\n\nTherefore, the only quadratic equation that satisfies the conditions is $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$.\n\nThere is $\\boxed{1}$ quadratic equation that satisfies the given conditions."}
