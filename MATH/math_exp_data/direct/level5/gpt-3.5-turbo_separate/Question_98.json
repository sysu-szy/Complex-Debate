{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "Let $p$ be the error in the measurement of the particle's momentum, $x$ be the error in the measurement of the particle's position, and $h$ be Planck's constant.\n\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we have:\n$$px \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$$\n\nGiven that the error in the measurement of momentum is halved, the new error in the measurement of momentum becomes $\\frac{p}{2}$.\n\nSubstitute this into the Uncertainty Principle:\n$$\\frac{p}{2} x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$$\n$$px \\geq \\frac{2h}{4\\pi}$$\n$$px \\geq \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$$\n\nNow we see that the new minimum error in the measurement of position is $\\frac{h}{2\\pi}$. The increase in the minimum error in the measurement of position is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x = \\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we calculate:\n$$\\text{Percentage increase} = \\frac{\\frac{x}{2} - x}{x} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{-\\frac{x}{2}}{x} \\cdot 100\\% = -\\frac{50\\%}{2} = -25\\%$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position increases by $\\boxed{25\\%}$."}
