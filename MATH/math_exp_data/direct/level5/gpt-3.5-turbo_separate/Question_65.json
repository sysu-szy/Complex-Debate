{"question": "The sum of the product and the sum of two positive integers is $454$. Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product.", "answer": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$. We know the first possibility above gives a value of zero, while all the others will be greater than zero. We check: \\begin{align*}\n4\\cdot 90\\cdot (4+90)&=4\\cdot 90\\cdot 94=33840\\\\\n6\\cdot 64\\cdot (6+64)&=6\\cdot 64\\cdot 70=26880\\\\\n12\\cdot 34\\cdot (12+34)&=12\\cdot 34\\cdot 46=18768.\n\\end{align*}Thus the largest possible desired value is $\\boxed{33840}$, achieved when $(a,b)=(4,90)$.", "agents_response": "Let the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$. We can write the given information as:\n\n1) $xy + (x+y) = 454$\n2) We are looking for the maximum value of $xy(x+y)$\n\nRewrite equation 1 as: $xy + x + y = 454$. \n\nNow, we are going to rewrite the product $xy(x+y)$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n$xy(x+y) = xy(x+y) + x^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2$\n$= (xy + x + y) (x+y) - (x^2 + y^2)$\n$= 454(x+y) - (x^2 + y^2)$\n\nSubstitute $x^2 + y^2$ with $(x+y)^2 - 2xy$: \n$454(x+y) - (x+y)^2 + 2xy$\n\nNotice that $(x+y)^2 - 2xy$ is always non-negative, and the maximum value of $454(x+y)$ is $454 \\times \\frac{454}{2} = 102781$. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $xy(x+y)$ is $\\boxed{102781}$."}
