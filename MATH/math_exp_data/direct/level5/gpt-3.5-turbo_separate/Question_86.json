{"question": "Two standard six-faced dice are rolled. Jean wins if the product of the two numbers rolled is odd or a multiple of three, otherwise Allen wins. What is the probability that Jean wins? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "When two dice are rolled, there are 36 total outcomes. Let's compute the probability that Allen wins. Allen wins if the product of the two numbers is even and not a multiple of 3. In other words, Allen wins if the product is 2 $(1\\cdot2, 2\\cdot1)$, 4 $(1\\cdot4, 4\\cdot1, 2\\cdot2)$, 8 $(2\\cdot4, 4\\cdot2)$, 10 $(2\\cdot5, 5\\cdot2)$, 16 $(4\\cdot4)$, or 20 $(4\\cdot5, 5\\cdot4)$. Therefore, the probability that Allen wins is $\\frac{2+3+2+2+1+2}{36}=12/36=1/3$. Then, the probability that Jean wins is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the probability that Jean wins, we first need to find the total number of outcomes when rolling two standard six-faced dice. Each dice has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes is $6*6=36$.\n\nNow, let's find the outcomes where Jean wins. A product is odd if and only if both numbers are odd. So, the odd numbers on a standard six-faced die are 1, 3, and 5. The outcomes where both numbers are odd are (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), for a total of 9 outcomes.\n\nNext, let's find the outcomes where the product is a multiple of 3. These outcomes are (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), for a total of 20 outcomes.\n\nHowever, there is overlap between the cases where the product is odd and the product is a multiple of 3 (specifically the outcomes (3,3) and (5,3)). So, we need to subtract the overlap which is 2 outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where Jean wins is $9 + 20 - 2 = 27$.\n\nThe probability that Jean wins is $\\frac{27}{36}=\\frac{3}{4}$\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}"}
