{"question": "How many ways are there to put 9 differently colored beads on a $3\\times3$ grid if the purple bead and the green bead cannot be adjacent (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and rotations and reflections of the grid are considered the same?", "answer": "There are $9!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not taking rotations, reflections, and the restriction on the purple and green beads into account. We need to subtract off the number of arrangements where the purple and green beads are adjacent from this number. There are $2\\cdot3=6$ horizontally adjacent pairs of locations, $3\\cdot2=6$ vertically adjacent ones, and $2\\cdot2+2\\cdot2=8$ pairs of diagonally adjacent locations. For each of these pairs, there are two ways to put the purple and green beads in them, and $7!$ ways to put the rest of the beads on the grid, giving a total of $2(6+6+8)7!=40\\cdot7!$ invalid arrangements. So, the number of valid arrangements not counting rotations and reflections is $9!-40\\cdot7!=(9\\cdot8-40)7!=32\\cdot7!$. The grid can be rotated onto itself in four different ways, by rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. It can also be reflected onto itself in four different ways, by reflecting across its two diagonals and through horizontal and vertical lines through its center. So, the arrangements come in groups of $4+4=8$ equivalent arrangements, and the number of different arrangements is $32\\cdot7!/8=4\\cdot7!=\\boxed{20160}$.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, we will use Polya's Enumeration Theorem.\n\n1. The identity: $a_1^9$\n2. Rotation by 90 degrees: $a_1^3a_3^2$.\n3. Rotation by 180 degrees: $a_1^3a_3^3$.\n4. Rotation by 270 degrees: $a_1^3a_3^2$.\n5. Reflection across a line running through midpoints of two opposite edges: $a_1^5a_2^2$.\n6. Reflection across a line running through midpoints of two adjacent edges: $a_1^6a_3$.\n\nNow, applying Burnside's Lemma:\n$\\frac{1}{8}(1\\cdot a_1^9 + 2\\cdot a_1^3a_3^2 + 2\\cdot a_1^3a_3^3 + 2\\cdot a_1^5a_2^2 + 1\\cdot a_1^6a_3) = \\frac{1}{8}(a_1^9 + 2a_1^3a_3^2 + 2a_1^3a_3^3 + 2a_1^5a_2^2 + a_1^6a_3)$\n\nNow, simplifying the expression:\n$\\frac{1}{8}(1 + 2\\cdot(3\\cdot3) + 2\\cdot(3\\cdot3) + 2\\cdot(5\\cdot4) + 1\\cdot(6\\cdot1)) = \\boxed{57}$."}
