{"question": "Let $f(x)$ be a function such that for all $x,$ $f(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x - 1).$  Given that $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15,$ compute $f(20152015).$", "answer": "Let $a = f(1)$ and $b = f(2).$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(3) &= f(2) - f(1) = b - a, \\\\\nf(4) &= f(3) - f(2) = (b - a) - b = -a, \\\\\nf(5) &= f(4) - f(3) = -a - (b - a) = -b, \\\\\nf(6) &= f(5) - f(4) = -b - (-a) = a - b, \\\\\nf(7) &= f(6) - f(5) = (a - b) - (-b) = a, \\\\\nf(8) &= f(7) - f(6) = a - (a - b) = b.\n\\end{align*}Since $f(7) = f(1)$ and $f(8) = f(2),$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the function becomes periodic from here on, with a period of length 6.\n\nThen $f(3) = f(15) = 20$ and $f(2) = f(20) = 15,$ and\n\\[f(20152015) = f(1) = f(2) - f(3) = 15 - 20 = \\boxed{-5}.\\]", "agents_response": "We first notice that the given recursive relation $f(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x - 1)$ is the Fibonacci sequence shifted by some constant. Since $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15,$ we can write a few terms of the sequence:\n\n$f(15) = f(16) + f(14) = 20$\n$f(16) = f(17) + f(15)$\n$f(17) = f(18) + f(16)$\n$f(18) = f(19) + f(17)$\n$f(19) = f(20) + f(18) = 15$\n$f(20) = f(21) + f(19)$\n\nFrom the above equations, we have $f(16) = 20 - f(14),$ $f(17) = 20 - f(15),$ $f(18) = 20 - f(16),$ and so on.\n\nTherefore, we find that $f(20152015) = 20 - f(20152013) = 20 - (20 - f(20152011)) = f(20152011) = \\dots = f(15) = \\boxed{20}$."}
