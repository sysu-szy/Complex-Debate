{"question": "Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial such that\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x\\]for all real numbers $x.$  Find the sum of all possible values of $P(10).$", "answer": "Let $d$ be the degree of $P(x).$  Then the degree of $P(P(x))$ is $d^2.$  Hence, the degree of $P(P(x)) + P(x)$ is $d^2,$ and the degree of $6x$ is 1, so we must have $d = 1.$\n\nAccordingly, let $P(x) = ax + b.$  Then\n\\[a(ax + b) + b + ax + b = 6x.\\]Expanding, we get $(a^2 + a) x + ab + 2b = 6x.$  Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + a &= 6, \\\\\nab + 2b &= 0.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $a^2 + a - 6 = 0,$ which factors as $(a - 2)(a + 3) = 0,$ so $a = 2$ or $a = -3.$\n\nFrom the second equation, $(a + 2) b = 0.$  Since $a$ cannot be $-2,$ $b = 0.$\n\nHence, $P(x) = 2x$ or $P(x) = -3x,$ and the sum of all possible values of $P(10)$ is $20 + (-30) = \\boxed{-10}.$", "agents_response": "Let the degree of $P(x)$ be $n$, then looking at the highest degree term of the polynomial on both sides of the original equation, we get $a_n^2x^{n^2} + a_nx^n = 6x$. This implies that the degree of $P(x)$ must be $1$, which means $P(x) = ax + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\nSubstitute $P(x) = ax+b$ into the original equation, we have\n\\[a(ax+b) + (ax+b) = 6x.\\]\nThis simplifies to $a^2x + (a+1)b = 6x.$\nThis equation holds for all $x$, so the coefficient of $x$ on the left side must be equal to the coefficient of $x$ on the right side, which gives us the system of equations\n\\begin{align*} a^2 &= 6, \\\\ a + 1 &= 0. \\end{align*}\nThe solutions to this system are $a = -3$ and $b = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $P(x) = -3x + 2$ and $P(10) = -3(10) + 2 = \\boxed{-28}$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{-28}\\]"}
