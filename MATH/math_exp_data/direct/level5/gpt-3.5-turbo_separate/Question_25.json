{"question": "Let $O$ be the origin, and let $OABC$ be a rectangle, where $A$ and $C$ lie on the parabola $y = x^2.$  Then vertex $B$ must lie on a fixed parabola.  Enter the equation of the fixed parabola in the form \"$y = px^2 + qx + r$\".", "answer": "Let $A = (a,a^2)$ and $C = (c,c^2).$  Since $\\overline{OA}$ and $\\overline{OC}$ are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is $-1$:\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{a} \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{c} = -1.\\]Thus, $ac = -1.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\npair A, B, C, O;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = (0.8,func(0.8));\nC = (-1/0.8,func(-1/0.8));\nB = A + C - O;\n\ndraw(graph(func,-1.6,1.6));\ndraw(O--A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndot(\"$A = (a,a^2)$\", A, SE);\ndot(\"$B$\", B, N);\ndot(\"$C = (c,c^2)$\", C, SW);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nAs a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide.  The midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is\n\\[\\left( \\frac{a + c}{2}, \\frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} \\right),\\]so $B = (a + c,a^2 + c^2).$\n\nLet $x = a + c$ and $y = a^2 + c^2.$  We want a relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the form of $y = px^2 + qx + r.$  We have that\n\\[x^2 = (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2 = y - 2,\\]so the fixed parabola is $\\boxed{y = x^2 + 2}.$", "agents_response": "The coordinates of $A$ and $C$ are $(a, a^2)$ and $(-a, a^2)$, respectively, for some $a > 0$. The slope of line $AC$ is $\\frac{a^2 - (-a^2)}{a - (-a)} = 0$, so $AC$ is horizontal and $B$ must be on the line $y = a^2$. Since $OB$ passes through the origin, the slope of $OB$ is $\\frac{a^2}{a} = a$, which allows us to write the equation of $OB$ as $y = ax$. Since $B$ is also on $y = a^2$, we have $a^2 = ax$, so $B = (a, a^2)$. We can see that $B$ is equidistant from $A$ and $C$, so it must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$, which is the vertix of the parabola $y = -\\frac{1}{a^2} x^2 + a^2$. Thus, the fixed parabola is $\\boxed{y = -\\frac{1}{x} x^2 + x}$.\n\n[Note: The fixed parabola is actually $y = -\\frac{1}{4x}x^2 + x$, but this simplifies to the form given above.]"}
