{"question": "A shop sells 500 smartphones a week for $\\$450$ each. A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars?", "answer": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.", "agents_response": "Let x represent the number of $5 decreases in price from the original $450 price. This means the new price of the smartphone will be $450 - 5x.\n\nWith each $5 decrease in price, the number of smartphones sold per week will increase by 10. Therefore, the number of smartphones sold per week will be 500 + 10x.\n\nRevenue is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of smartphones sold, so the revenue function can be represented as:\nRevenue = (450 - 5x)(500 + 10x)\n\nExpanding the revenue function:\nRevenue = 450(500) + 450(10x) - 5x(500) - 5x(10x)\nRevenue = 225000 + 4500x - 2500x - 50x^2\nRevenue = -50x^2 + 2000x + 225000\n\nTo find the price that will result in maximum revenue, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic function -50x^2 + 2000x + 225000.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\nx = -b / (2a) = -2000 / (2*(-50)) = 20\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, substitute x = 20 into the revenue function:\nRevenue = -50(20)^2 + 2000(20) + 225000\nRevenue = -50(400) + 40000 + 225000\nRevenue = -20000 + 40000 + 225000\nRevenue = 245000\n\nTherefore, the price of the smartphone that will result in maximum revenue is $450 - 5(20) = $350.\nThe maximum revenue will be $\\boxed{245000}."}
