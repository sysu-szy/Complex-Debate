{"question": "We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and\n\n$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd\n\n$f(b)=\\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.\n\nWhat is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?", "answer": "Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \\begin{align*}\nf(11)&=34\\\\\nf(34)&=17\\\\\nf(17)&=52\\\\\nf(52)&=26\\\\\nf(26)&=13\\\\\nf(13)&=40\\\\\nf(40)&=20\\\\\nf(20)&=10\\\\\nf(10)&=5\\\\\nf(5)&=16\\\\\nf(16)&=8\\\\\nf(8)&=4\\\\\nf(4)&=2\\\\\nf(2)&=1\\\\\nf(1)&=4\n\\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\\boxed{18}$.", "agents_response": "We start with $f(14) = 7$. Since $7$ is odd, we have $f(7) = 3(7) + 1 = 22$. Since $22$ is even, we have $f(22) = \\frac{22}{2} = 11$. Since $11$ is odd, we have $f(11) = 3(11) + 1 = 34$. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we find that the sequence is $14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$. Since we have reached $1$ and we know that the sequence will continue until reaching $1$ again and repeating the cycle $1, 4, 2$, the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{18}$."}
