{"question": "If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)", "answer": "First, we factor $10!:$\n\\begin{align*} 10!&=10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\\\ &=2^8\\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7.\\end{align*}\nHence, $x$ can be $1, 2^1, 2^2, 3, 2^1\\cdot 3,\\text{ or }2^2\\cdot 3$ for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ possible values of $x.$", "agents_response": "To find the number of possible integer values of $x$ such that $x^3$ is a factor of $10!$, we consider the prime factorization of $10!$.\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of $10$:\n$10 = 2 \\cdot 5$\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of $10!$ is:\n$10! = 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$\n\nFor $x^3$ to be a factor of $10!$, we need $x^3$ to be comprised of at least $3$ twos, $1$ three, and $1$ five from the prime factorization of $10!$.\n\nSo, $x = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $a \\geq 3$, $b \\geq 1$, and $c \\geq 1.$\n\nSince $x^3$ must be a factor of $10!$, we must have $3a \\leq 8, 3b \\leq 4, 3c \\leq 2.$\n\nThere are $3$, $2$, and $1$ possible values respectively for $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible integer values of $x$ is $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$.\n\nThus, the answer is therefore $\\boxed{6}$."}
