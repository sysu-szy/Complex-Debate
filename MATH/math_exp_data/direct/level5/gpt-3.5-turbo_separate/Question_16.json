{"question": "Let $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$.  Find the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x)=f(f(x))$.", "answer": "There are two ways for $x$ to not be in the domain of $g$: it can not be in the domain of $f$, or it can be in the domain of $f$ but not in the domain of $f\\circ f$.  In the first case, the denominator of $f$ is zero, so\n$$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$$For the second case, we see that the denominator of $f(f(x))$ is $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3$.  If this is zero, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} = 3 \\implies x-3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x = 3+\\frac13 = \\frac{10}3.\\]This is greater than $3$, so the largest $x$ not in the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{\\tfrac{10}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "The largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$ is when $x=3$, since dividing by zero is undefined.\n\nNow, in order for $f(f(x))=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x-3}-3}$ to be defined, the denominator cannot be zero. So, we set $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3 \\neq 0$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{x-3}-3 \\neq 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{x-3} \\neq 3 \\\\\n1 \\neq 3(x-3) \\\\\n1 \\neq 3x-9 \\\\\n10 \\neq 3x \\\\\nx \\neq \\frac{10}{3}$\n\nTherefore, the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x)=f(f(x))$ is $\\boxed{x=\\frac{10}{3}}$."}
