{"question": "An airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?", "answer": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$.", "agents_response": "We can see that the altitude increases by 100 feet every second. To find out how many seconds it will take for the plane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet, we can set up the equation:\n\n100 + 200 + 300 + ... = 12,000\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 100 and we want to find the sum when reaching 12,000 feet. We can write it as:\n\nn/2 * (first term + last term) = 12,000\nn/2 * (100 + 100(n-1)) = 12,000\nn(100 + 100n - 100) = 24,000\nn(100n) = 24,000\n100n^2 = 24,000\nn^2 = 240\nn = 15.49 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take the plane approximately 15.49 seconds to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height.\n\n\\boxed{15.49}"}
