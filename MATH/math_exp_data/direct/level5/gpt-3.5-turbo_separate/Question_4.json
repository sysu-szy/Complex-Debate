{"question": "A number is doubled, then decreased by $13.7$.  The result is greater than $125.28$. What is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the desired integer. Then $2x-13.7>125.28$.  Adding $13.7$ to both sides gives $2x>138.98$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives $x>69.49$.  The smallest integer that is greater than $69.49$ is $\\boxed{70}$.", "agents_response": "Let the number be $x$. The given condition can be expressed as $2x-13.7>125.28$.\nSolving for $x$:\n$2x>138.98$\n$x>69.49$\n\nThe smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $\\boxed{70}$."}
