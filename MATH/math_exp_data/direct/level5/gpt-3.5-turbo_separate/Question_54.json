{"question": "Find the smallest positive integer that is greater than $1$ and relatively prime to the product of the first 20 positive integers.  Reminder: two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.", "answer": "Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no prime factors.  Therefore, the desired positive integer must not share any prime factors with the product of the first 20 positive integers.  So, every prime in the prime factorization of the desired positive integer is greater than 20, which means the smallest possible integer is $\\boxed{23}$.", "agents_response": "The product of the first 20 positive integers is $20!$. To find the smallest positive integer that is relatively prime to $20!$, we need to find the product of all prime numbers less than or equal to 20, because any other integer will have at least one prime factor that divides into $20!$.\n\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 20 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nMultiplying these primes together gives us $2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19 = 9699690$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is relatively prime to $20!$ is $\\boxed{9699691}$."}
