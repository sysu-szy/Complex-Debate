{"question": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?", "answer": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.", "agents_response": "To have more girls than boys on the team, we can have 4 girls and 2 boys or 5 girls and 1 boy.\n\nNumber of ways to select 4 girls and 2 boys: 8 choose 4 * 6 choose 2 \n= (8C4) * (6C2) \n= 70 * 15 \n= 1050\n\nNumber of ways to select 5 girls and 1 boy: 8 choose 5 * 6 choose 1 \n= (8C5) * (6C1) \n= 56 * 6 \n= 336\n\nTotal ways to select a team with more girls than boys: 1050 + 336 = 1386\n\n\\boxed{1386}"}
