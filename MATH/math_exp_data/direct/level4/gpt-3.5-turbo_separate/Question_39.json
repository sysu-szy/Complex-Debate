{"question": "Find the radius of the circle with equation $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0$.", "answer": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 49 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49$. It follows that the square of the radius is 49, so the radius must be $\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "To find the radius of the circle, we rewrite the given equation in the standard form of the equation of a circle $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nWe complete the square for $x$ and $y$ terms:\n$x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) = 36 + 4 + 9$\n$(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49$\n\nFrom the standard form, we see that the center of the circle is at $(2, 3)$ and the square of the radius is $49$. Therefore, the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$.\n\n\\boxed{7}"}
