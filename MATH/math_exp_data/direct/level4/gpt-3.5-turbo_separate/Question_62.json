{"question": "Let $S$ be the set of complex numbers of the form $a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.  We say that $z \\in S$ is a unit if there exists a $w \\in S$ such that $zw = 1.$  Find the number of units in $S.$", "answer": "Let $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di.$  We want $zw = 1.$  Then $|zw| = |z||w| = 1,$ so $|z|^2 |w|^2 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 1.\\]If both $a = b = 0,$ then $z = 0,$ so $zw = 0.$  Hence, $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 1.$  Similarly, we can show that $c^2 + d^2 \\ge 1.$  Then\n\\[(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \\ge 1.\\]But $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 1,$ and the only way to get equality is if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2 = 1.$\n\nIf $a^2 + b^2 = 1,$ then one of $a,$ $b$ must be 0 and the other must be $\\pm 1.$  Thus, $z$ can only be 1, $-1,$ $i,$ or $-i.$  It is easy to check that all $\\boxed{4}$ complex numbers are units.", "agents_response": "The number of units in $S$ is equal to the number of elements in $S$ that have a multiplicative inverse also in $S.$ This is equivalent to finding the number of elements in $S$ whose product with another element in $S$ is equal to $1.$\n\nLet $z = a + bi$ be an element in $S.$ We want to find $w = c + di$ such that $zw = 1.$\nThis gives us the equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nac - bd &= 1 \\\\\nad + bc &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, $ad = -bc.$ Substitute this into the first equation:\n\\[ac - bd = 1 \\implies ac - b(-\\frac{ad}{b}) = 1 \\implies a(c + \\frac{a}{b}d) = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{b}{a^2 + b^2} \\text{ and } d = -\\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}\\]\n\nSince both $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a^2 + b^2$ must be $1$ for $z$ to be a unit.\n\nHence, there are $\\boxed{2}$ units in $S,$ namely $1$ and $-1.$"}
