{"question": "What is the average of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ if the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7 and the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8?", "answer": "We can rephrase the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2} &= 7\\\\\n\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 8\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2}+\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 7+8\\\\\n\\frac{2a+2b+2c}{2} &= 15\\\\\na+b+c &= 15\\\\\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3} &= \\frac{15}{3} = \\boxed{5}\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "Let us first write out the equations given:\n$\\frac{a + 2b}{2} = 7 \\implies a + 2b = 14$\n$\\frac{a + 2c}{2} = 8 \\implies a + 2c = 16$\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$a + 2b = 14$\n$a + 2c = 16$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n$2c - 2b = 2$\n$c - b = 1$\n\nSince $b$ is an integer, the only possible values are $b = 1$ and $c = 2$. Using these values in one of the original equations we can find $a$:\n$a + 2(1) = 14$\n$a = 12$\n\nFinally, we find the average of $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$\\frac{12 + 1 + 2}{3} = \\boxed{5}$"}
