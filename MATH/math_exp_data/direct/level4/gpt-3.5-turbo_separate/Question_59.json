{"question": "The first and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are $\\frac23$ and $\\frac45$, respectively. What is the fifth term?", "answer": "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}.\\]", "agents_response": "The common difference of an arithmetic sequence is the same between consecutive terms. \n\nLet $d$ be the common difference. \n\nWe are given that the first term is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and the ninth term is $\\frac{4}{5}$. \n\nFrom the formula for the general nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\]\nwe can set up the following equations:\n\\[a_1 = \\frac{2}{3} = a_1\\]\n\\[a_9 = \\frac{4}{5} = a_1 + 8d\\]\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\\[\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3} = 8d\\]\n\\[\\frac{12}{15} - \\frac{10}{15} = 8d\\]\n\\[\\frac{2}{15} = 8d\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{1}{60}\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the nth term again:\n\\[a_5 = a_1 + 4d = \\frac{2}{3} + 4\\left(\\frac{1}{60}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{10}{15} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}\\]\n\nSo, the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}$."}
