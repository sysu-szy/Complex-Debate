{"question": "A group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip. If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?", "answer": "We are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\\boxed{66}$.", "agents_response": "Let $N = 8k + 5 = 6m + 3$ where $k$ and $m$ are integers.\n\nSince $N < 50$, $N = 8k + 5 < 50 \\Rightarrow k < 6.25$. The possible values of $k$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nFor $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, we get $N = 5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $N$ is $5 + 13 + 21 + 29 + 37 + 45 = \\boxed{150}$."}
