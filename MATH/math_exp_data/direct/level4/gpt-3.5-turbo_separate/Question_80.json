{"question": "In how many ways can a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer be chosen from a group of $4$ guys and $4$ girls and at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions? One person cannot serve in more than one position.", "answer": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices.", "agents_response": "We will find the total number of ways to choose the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer first, which is $8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336$. \n\nNext, we will find the number of ways in which all three positions are held by guys, which is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$. Similarly, the number of ways in which all three positions are held by girls is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$. \n\nWe can also find the number of ways in which exactly one girl holds a position and the other two are held by guys. There are ${4 \\choose 1}$ ways to choose which girl holds a position, and ${4 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose which two guys hold the other two positions. This gives a total of ${4 \\choose 1} \\cdot {4 \\choose 2} = 24$ ways.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways in which exactly one guy holds a position and the other two are held by girls is also $24$. \n\nHowever, we have counted the cases where everyone is the same gender (3 guys or 3 girls) twice, so we will subtract those. There are $4$ such cases (3 guys) and $4$ such cases (3 girls). \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid ways to choose the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer where at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions is $336 - 24 - 24 - 24 - 24 + 4 + 4 = 268$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{268}$."}
