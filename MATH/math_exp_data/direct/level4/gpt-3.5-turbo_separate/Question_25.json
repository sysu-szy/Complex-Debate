{"question": "A sequence of complex numbers $z_0,z_1,z_2,\\ldots$ is defined by the rule \\[\nz_{n+1}=\\frac{\\ iz_n\\ }{\\overline{z}_n},\n\\]where $\\overline{z}_n$ is the complex conjugate of $z_n$ and $i^2=-1$. Suppose that $|z_0|=1$ and $z_{2005}=1$. How many possible values are there for $z_0$?", "answer": "Note that \\[\nz_{n+1}=\\frac{iz_n}{\\overline{z}_n}=\\frac{iz_n^2}{z_n\\overline{z}_n}=\\frac{iz_n^2}{|z_n|^2}.\n\\]Since $|z_0|=1$, the sequence satisfies \\[\nz_1 = i z_0^2, \\ z_2 = iz_1^2 = i\\left(iz_0^2\\right)^2 = -iz_0^4,\n\\]and, in general, when $k\\ge 2$, \\[\nz_k = -iz_0^{2^k}.\n\\]Hence $z_0$ satisfies the equation $1 =-iz_0^{(2^{2005})}$, so $z_0^{(2^{2005})} = i.$ Because every nonzero complex number has $n$ distinct $n$th roots, this  equation has $2^{2005}$ solutions. So there are $\\boxed{2^{2005}}$ possible values for $z_0$.", "agents_response": "Let $z_0 = a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. We have $|z_0|=1$ which means $a^2+b^2=1$. \n\nLet's look at the sequence of $z_n$ values when $z_0$ is a complex number with $|z_0|=1$:\n\\[z_1 = \\frac{iz_0}{\\overline{z}_0} = i\\]\n\\[z_2 = \\frac{i^2}{\\overline{i}} = -1\\]\n\\[z_3 = \\frac{i(-1)}{\\overline{-1}} = -i\\]\n\\[z_4 = \\frac{i(-i)}{\\overline{-i}} = 1\\]\n\nFrom above, we see that the sequence $\\{z_n\\}$ will repeat after every 4 terms. Since $z_{2005} = 1$, the value of $z_0$ will determine the entire sequence. \n\nThus, the possible values of $z_0$ are the complex numbers satisfying $z_0 = z_k$ where $k$ is a nonnegative integer such that $0 \\leq k < 4$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for $z_0$."}
