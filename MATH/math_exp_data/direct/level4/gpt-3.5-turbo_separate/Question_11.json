{"question": "What is the area, in square units, of the square with the four vertices at $(-2, 2), (2, -2), (-2, -6)$, and $(-6, -2)$?", "answer": "The length of the square is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{32}$.", "agents_response": "We can find the side length of the square by using the distance formula between two points.\n\nDistance between $(-2, 2)$ and $(2, -2)$:\n$\\sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo, the side length is $4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe area of a square is side length squared.\nSo, the area is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{32}$."}
