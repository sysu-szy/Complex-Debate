{"question": "A star-polygon is drawn on a clock face by drawing a chord from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise from that number.  That is, chords are drawn from 12 to 5, from 5 to 10, from 10 to 3, and so on, ending back at 12.  What is the degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon?", "answer": "Consider the two chords with an endpoint at 5. The arc subtended by the angle determined by these chords extends from 10 to 12, so the degree measure of the arc is $(2/12)(360)=60$.  By the Central Angle Theorem, the degree measure of this angle is $(1/2)(60)=30$. By symmetry, the degree measure of the angle at each vertex is $\\boxed{30}$.", "agents_response": "Each vertex in the star-polygon is formed by connecting two vertices of the regular 12-gon on the clock face. The interior angle of a regular 12-gon is given by 180(1 - 2/12) = 150 degrees. Therefore, the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon is half the interior angle of the regular 12-gon, which is 150/2 = \\boxed{75} degrees."}
