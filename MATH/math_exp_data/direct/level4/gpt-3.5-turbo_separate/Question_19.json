{"question": "Without looking at the labels, Adrien placed four CDs in four cases. What is the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases, we can first determine the total number of ways that the CDs can be placed in the cases. There are 4! = 24 ways in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases. There are 4 ways to choose which two CDs are in the wrong cases, and then there are 2 ways to arrange the two incorrectly placed CDs, while the other two are correctly placed. This gives a total of 4*2 = 8 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases is 8/24 = 1/3.\n\n\\boxed{1/3}"}
