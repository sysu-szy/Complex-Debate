{"question": "Find the remainder when the polynomial $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x$ is divided by $x^3-x$.", "answer": "Since $x^3-x = x(x^2-1) = x(x+1)(x-1)$ has degree $3$, we know that the remainder is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the quotient be $q(x)$. Then,\n$$x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x =x(x+1)(x-1)q(x) +  ax^2+bx+c.$$If we plug in $x=0$, we get $c=0$. If we plug in $x=1$, we get $5 = a+b$. And if we plug in $x=-1$ we get $-1= a-b$.\nSolving these two equations together gives us $a=2$ and $b=3$ which means the remainder is $\\boxed{2x^2+3x}$.", "agents_response": "To find the remainder when the polynomial is divided by $x^3-x$, we can first factor out $x$ from each term in the polynomial to get $x(x^{17}+x^{12}+x^6+x^3+1)$.\n\nNow, we see that $x(x^{17}+x^{12}+x^6+x^3+1)$ has a similar form to the original polynomial. We now observe that $x^3-x=x(x^2-1)$, which can be factored further to $x(x+1)(x-1)$. \n\nWe can now try to find the roots of $x^{17}+x^{12}+x^6+x^3+1$ by plugging in $x=1$, $x=-1$, and $x=0$ into the polynomial. We find that $x=1$ is a root of the polynomial. Therefore, when the polynomial is divided by $x^3-x$, the remainder is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the polynomial $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x$ is divided by $x^3-x$ is $\\boxed{1}$."}
