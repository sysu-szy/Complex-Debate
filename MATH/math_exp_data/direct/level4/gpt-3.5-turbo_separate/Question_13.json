{"question": "Suppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books. In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?", "answer": "We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$", "agents_response": "First, we calculate the total number of ways to stack the $6$ books on the shelf, disregarding the condition about the math books. This is simply $6! = 720$ ways.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways in which the math books are next to each other. Since there are $2$ math books, we consider them as a single unit. Hence, there are $5$ units to stack - the math unit and the $4$ other books. This can be done in $5!$ ways. Within the math unit, the math books can be arranged in $2!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways in which the math books are next to each other is $5! \\times 2! = 240$.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of ways in which the math books are next to each other from the total number of ways to get the number of ways that satisfies the condition. Thus, the answer is $720 - 240 = 480$.\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{480}."}
