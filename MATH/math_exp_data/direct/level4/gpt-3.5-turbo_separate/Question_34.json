{"question": "What is the least common multiple of all positive integers smaller than 8?", "answer": "We write out the prime factorization of all natural numbers smaller than 8: \\[1, \\: 2, \\: 3, \\: 2^2, \\: 5, \\: 2 \\cdot 3, \\: 7.\\]Multiplying the highest power of each prime number together yields a desired least common multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{420}$.", "agents_response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of all positive integers smaller than 8, we first need to list out the prime factorization of each number:\n\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of all positive integers smaller than 8 is \\boxed{420}."}
