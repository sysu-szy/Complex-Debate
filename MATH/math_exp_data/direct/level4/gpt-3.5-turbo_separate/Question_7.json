{"question": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.", "answer": "The intersection of the asymptotes is $(5,7),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 2,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form\n\\[(x - 5)^2 - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = d\\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 4$ and $y = 7,$ we get $d = 1,$ so the equation is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 5)^2}{1} - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = 1.\\]Then $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 4,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 5,$ which means $c = \\sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{5}}.$", "agents_response": "The general form of the equation of a hyperbola is $\\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the hyperbola and $a$ and $b$ are the distances from the center to the vertices along the x-axis and y-axis respectively.\n\nGiven the asymptotes $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x$, we have that the center of the hyperbola lies on the line $y = 2x + c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant. Since the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find $c$. Therefore, $7 = 2(4) + c \\Rightarrow c = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the center of the hyperbola is $(-1,1)$. To find $a$, the distance from the center to the vertices along the x-axis, we can consider the slopes of the asymptotes. The slope of the first asymptote is $2$, and the slope of the second asymptote is $-2$. Since the product of the slopes of the asymptotes should be equal to $-1$ for a hyperbola, we have\n\n$$2 \\cdot (-2) = -1 \\Rightarrow b = \\sqrt{2^2 - (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{2}.$$\n\nThe distance between the foci for a hyperbola is \n\n$$2 \\cdot \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{4 + 8} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{12} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}.$$"}
