{"question": "Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?", "answer": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$.", "agents_response": "Let the time Mike has ridden be $t$ hours. \nThen Josh has ridden for $2t$ hours. \n\nLet $r$ be Mike's rate in miles per hour. \nJosh's rate is $4r/5$ miles per hour. \n\nDistance = Rate x Time \nFrom Josh's perspective: $13 = \\frac{4r}{5} \\cdot 2t$\nFrom Mike's perspective: $13 = r \\cdot t$\n\nSolving the two equations, we get $r = \\frac{65}{6}$ and $t = \\frac{78}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the distance Mike has ridden is: $r \\cdot t = \\frac{65}{6} \\cdot \\frac{78}{5} = \\frac{65 \\cdot 78}{6 \\cdot 5} = \\boxed{169.5}$ miles."}
