{"question": "The diameter of a circle is 16. By what number must the radius be decreased in order to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$?", "answer": "If the diameter of the circle is $16$, then its radius is $8$. The area of this circle is then $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (8^2) = 64 \\pi$. If we want the area of the new circle to be $48 \\pi$ less than the area of this one, then the new circle must have an area of $64 \\pi - 48 \\pi = 16 \\pi$. Now that we know the area of this circle, we can find its radius $R$ by setting $\\pi R^2$ equal to $16 \\pi$, so we have that $\\pi R^2 = 16 \\pi$ and $R = 4$.\n\nThe radius of the first circle was $8$ and the new radius is $4$, so the radius was decreased by $8-4=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "Let the radius of the circle be $r$. \nThe diameter of the circle is $2r$, which is given as 16. Therefore, $2r = 16 \\Rightarrow r = 8$. \nThe area of the circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2$. \nWe want to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$, so the new area will be $\\pi(r-x)^2 = \\pi r^2 - 48\\pi$, where $x$ is the number by which the radius must be decreased. \nExpanding and simplifying, we get: $\\pi(r^2 - 2rx + x^2) = \\pi r^2 - 48\\pi$. \nSubstitute $r = 8$ and $r^2 = 64$ into the equation: $64 - 16x + x^2 = 64 - 48 \\Rightarrow x^2 - 16x = -48$. \nRearranging the equation we get: $x^2 - 16x + 48 = 0$. \nFactoring the equation we get: $(x-12)(x-4) = 0$. \nTherefore, $x = 12,4$. \nSince $x$ is the number by which the radius must be decreased, $x = \\boxed{4}$."}
