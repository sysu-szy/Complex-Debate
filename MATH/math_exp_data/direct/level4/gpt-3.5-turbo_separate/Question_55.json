{"question": "If $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac52$, solve for $y$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.", "answer": "To begin, we observe that the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}$ is defined if and only if $y>0$. In this case, it is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{6y+2}{2y}}$. Since the quantity under the radical is always nonnegative for $y>0$, we may safely square both sides of our equation without creating fake solutions: $$\\frac{6y+2}{2y}=\\frac{25}{4}.$$Now we cross-multiply to obtain $$4(6y+2) = 25(2y),$$and solve this linear equation: \\begin{align*}\n24y+8 &= 50y \\\\\n8 &= 26y \\\\\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}} &= y\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "To solve this equation, we first square both sides to eliminate the square roots. \n\n$(\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}})^2 =  (\\frac{5}{2})^2$\n\n$\\frac{6y+2}{2y} = \\frac{25}{4}$\n\nCross multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n$4(6y+2) = 25(2y)$\n\n$24y+8 = 50y$\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n$8 = 50y - 24y$\n\n$8 = 26y$\n\n$y = \\frac{8}{26} = \\frac{4}{13}$\n\nTherefore, the value of y is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}$."}
