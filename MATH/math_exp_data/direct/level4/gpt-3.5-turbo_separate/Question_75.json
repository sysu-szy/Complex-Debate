{"question": "There is a unique pair of positive real numbers satisfying the equations \\[ x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4 = 8 \\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad x^3y-xy^3 = 2\\sqrt{3}. \\]Determine $x$, writing your answer in the form $a\\cos\\theta$, with $\\theta$ in degrees.", "answer": "Once we realize to multiply the second equation by 4, the terms in the equations look very much like the expansion of $(x+y)^4$, with some negative signs appearing.  Closer inspection reveals that the two given equations are equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of a single statement involving complex numbers: \\[ (x+iy)^4 = 8 + 8i\\sqrt{3} = 16e^{\\pi i/3}. \\]In other words, we need only find the fourth root of $16e^{\\pi i/3}$ in the first quadrant, where $x$ and $y$ will both be positive.  Thus $x+iy=2e^{\\pi i/12}$; taking the real part yields our answer $x=2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) = \\boxed{2\\cos 15^{\\circ}}$.", "agents_response": "We first notice that the given equations can be rewritten as:\n\\[(x^2-y^2)^2 = 8\\]\n\\[xy(x^2-y^2) = 2\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nLet $a = x^2 - y^2$ and $b = xy$. Then we have:\n\\[a^2 = 8\\]\n\\[ab = 2\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nSolving these equations, we find that $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$, $b = \\sqrt{3}$. \n\nWe also have $x^2 - y^2 = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$, we have $x + y = 2\\sqrt{2}$ or $x - y = 2\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:\nIf $x + y = 2\\sqrt{2}$ and $xy = \\sqrt{3}$, then we can solve for $x$ and $y$ using the quadratic equation:\n\\[t^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}t + \\sqrt{3} = 0\\]\nThis gives $t = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ or $\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $x = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$, $y = \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nIf $x - y = 2\\sqrt{2}$ and $xy = \\sqrt{3}$, then we can solve for $x$ and $y$ using the quadratic equation:\n\\[t^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}t - \\sqrt{3} = 0\\]\nThis gives $t = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ or $-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $x = -\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$, $y = -\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSince the question asks for the positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $x = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}}$, $y = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}}$."}
