{"question": "The radius of a right circular cylinder is decreased by $20\\%$ and its height is increased by $25\\%$. What is the absolute value of the percent change in the volume of the cylinder?", "answer": "Let the original radius and height be $r$ and $h$ respectively, so the original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.\n\nThe new radius and height are $\\frac{4}{5}r$ and $\\frac{5}{4}h$ respectively, so the new volume is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{5}r\\right)^2 \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi r^2 h$, which is $20\\%$ less than the original volume.\n\nHence the desired percent change is $\\boxed{20}$ percent.", "agents_response": "Let $r$ be the original radius and $h$ be the original height. After the changes, the new radius is $0.8r$ and the new height is $1.25h$.\n\nThe original volume of the cylinder is $\\pi r^2h$ and the new volume is $\\pi (0.8r)^2(1.25h) = \\pi (0.64r^2)(1.25h) = 0.8\\pi r^2h$.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of the percent change in the volume is $|100(0.8 - 1)| = \\boxed{20\\%}$."}
