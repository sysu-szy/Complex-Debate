{"question": "If the roots of the quadratic equation $\\frac12x^2+99x+c=0$ are $x=-99+\\sqrt{8001}$ and $x=-99-\\sqrt{8001}$, then what is the value of $c$?", "answer": "By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are $$x=\\frac{-(99)\\pm\\sqrt{(99)^2-4(\\frac12)c}}{2(\\frac12)},$$which simplifies to $$x=-99\\pm\\sqrt{9801-2c}.$$This looks like our target, except that we have to get the $9801-2c$ under the radical to equal $8001$. So, we solve the equation $9801-2c=8001$, which yields $c=\\boxed{900}$.", "agents_response": "The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is given by $c/a$.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $-99+\\sqrt{8001}-99-\\sqrt{8001}=-198$, and the product of the roots is $(-99+\\sqrt{8001})(-99-\\sqrt{8001})=-99^2-8001=-9801$.\n\nTherefore, $c=\\text{product of the roots}=-9801$.\n\nThus, the value of $c$ is $\\boxed{-9801}$."}
