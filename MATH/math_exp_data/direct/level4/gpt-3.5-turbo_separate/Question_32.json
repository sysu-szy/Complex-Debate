{"question": "Let $x=\\frac{7}{8}$ and $y=-\\frac{2}{9}$.  If $x\\cdot z = y$, then what is $z$?", "answer": "Plug in the values of $y$ and $x$, we have $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot z = -\\frac{2}{9}$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{7}{8}$, we have $z = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{7}{8}}$.  Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $x = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} = \\frac{-2\\cdot8}{9\\cdot7}$ = $\\boxed{-\\frac{16}{63}}$.", "agents_response": "Given $x=\\frac{7}{8}$, $y=-\\frac{2}{9}$, and $x\\cdot z = y$, we can solve for $z$. \n\nSubstitute the given values: $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot z = -\\frac{2}{9}$.\n\nMultiply both sides by $8$ to isolate $z$: $7z = -\\frac{16}{9}$.\n\nDivide by $7$ to solve for $z$: $z = -\\frac{16}{63}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{z=-\\frac{16}{63}}$."}
