{"question": "If $3+\\sqrt{5}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^2 - 3x + b = 0,\\]compute $b.$", "answer": "We do not know that $b$ is rational, so we cannot conclude that the radical conjugate of $3+\\sqrt{5},$ or $3-\\sqrt{5},$ must also be a root of the equation. Instead, we turn to Vieta's formulas: the sum of the roots of the equation is $3,$ so the other root of the equation must be $3 - (3+\\sqrt5) = -\\sqrt5.$ Then $b$ equals the product of the roots: \\[b = -\\sqrt5(3+\\sqrt5) = \\boxed{-3\\sqrt5-5}.\\]Alternatively, since $3 + \\sqrt{5}$ is a root of the equation,\n\\[(3 + \\sqrt{5})^2 - 3(3 + \\sqrt{5}) + b = 0.\\]Hence, $b = \\boxed{-3 \\sqrt{5} - 5}.$", "agents_response": "Let the other root of the equation be $r$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of the equation $x^2 - 3x + b = 0$ is equal to $3$. Therefore, we have\n\\[\\begin{aligned} r + 3 + \\sqrt{5} &= 3 \\\\ r &= -3 - \\sqrt{5} \\end{aligned}\\]\n\nSince the product of the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 3x + b = 0$ is equal to $b$, we have\n\\[b = (3 + \\sqrt{5})(-3 - \\sqrt{5}) = -9 - 3\\sqrt{5} + 3\\sqrt{5} - 5 = \\boxed{-14}\\]"}
