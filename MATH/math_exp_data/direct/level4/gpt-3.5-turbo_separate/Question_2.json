{"question": "The equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 60 feet per second from a height of 54 feet from the ground, where $t$ represents time, measured in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.", "answer": "Setting $y$ to zero, we find the following: \\begin{align*}\n0& = -16t^2 - 60t + 54\\\\\n& = 16t^2 + 60t - 54\\\\\n& = 8t^2 + 30t - 27\\\\\n& = (4t-3)(2t+9)\\\\\n\\end{align*}As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \\frac{3}{4} = \\boxed{0.75}.$", "agents_response": "To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to find the time when the height is equal to 0. So we set $y$ equal to 0 and solve for $t$.\n\n$0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$\n\nTo make this equation easier to work with, let's divide every term by 2:\n\n$0 = -8t^2 - 30t + 27$\n\nNow, we can attempt to factor this quadratic equation. After trying different factor pairs, we find:\n\n$0 = -(8t-3)(t+9)$\n\nSetting each factor equal to 0 gives us:\n\n$8t - 3 = 0$ or $t + 9 = 0$\n\n$8t = 3$ or $t = -9$\n\n$t = \\frac{3}{8}$ or $t = -9$\n\nSince time cannot be negative, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 0.38 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the ball will hit the ground in $\\boxed{0.38}$ seconds."}
