{"question": "A parabola has vertex of $(4,-5)$ and has two $x$-intercepts, one positive, and one negative.  If this parabola is the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c,$ which of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be positive?\n\nEnter the coefficients that must be positive, separated by commas.  For example, if you think $a$ and $c$ must be positive, enter \"$a,$ $c$\", without the quotation marks.", "answer": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$", "agents_response": "Given that the parabola has a vertex of $(4,-5)$, the parabola is facing upwards, meaning that $a$ must be positive. Additionally, since the parabola has two $x$-intercepts, one positive and one negative, this means that the parabola must cross the $x$-axis, indicating that $c$ must be negative. Therefore, the coefficients that must be positive are $\\boxed{a, b}$."}
