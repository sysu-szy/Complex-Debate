{"question": "How many times does the digit 8 appear in the list of all integers from 1 to 1000?", "answer": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.", "agents_response": "To find how many times the digit 8 appears in the list of all integers from 1 to 1000, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. For the units place, 8 appears once in every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 98, 108, 118, ..., 998. There are a total of 100 such numbers.\n\n2. For the tens place, 8 appears once in every 100 numbers: 80, 81, 82, ..., 89, 180, 181, ..., 189, ..., 980, 981, ..., 989. There are a total of 100 such numbers.\n\n3. For the hundreds place, 8 appears once in every 1000 numbers: 800, 801, 802, ..., 899. There are a total of 100 such numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of times the digit 8 appears in the list of all integers from 1 to 1000 is 100 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{300}."}
