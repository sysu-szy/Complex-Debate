{"question": "Give the greatest common divisor of $6^3$ and $3^6$.", "answer": "We notice that $6^3 = (2 \\cdot 3)^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3$. Since $2$ does not divide $3^6$, we only need to consider powers of $3$. Indeed, $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ is the highest power of $3$ which divides both numbers, so it is the greatest common divisor.", "agents_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $6^3$ and $3^6$, we can first write each number in terms of prime factorization:\n$6^3 = 2^3 \\times 3^3$,\n$3^6 = 3^6$.\n\nNow, the greatest common divisor is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they occur. In this case, the common prime factor is $3$ and it occurs to the power of $3$ in $6^3$ and to the power of $6$ in $3^6$. So, the greatest common divisor is $3^3 = 27$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{27}."}
