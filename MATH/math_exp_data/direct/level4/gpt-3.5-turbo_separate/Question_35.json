{"question": "Find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers for which $x^2+ax+b$ has a non-real root whose cube is $343$.", "answer": "We want $x$ to satisfy $x^3 = 343.$  Then $x^3 - 343 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 7)(x^2 + 7x + 49) = 0.$  Thus, $(a,b) = \\boxed{(7,49)}.$", "agents_response": "Let the non-real root be $r$. Since $r$ is non-real, we can write $r = xi$ for some nonzero real number $x$. We are given that $r^3 = (xi)^3 = 343$. Therefore, \n\\begin{align*}\n(xi)^3 &= 343\\\\\n-ix^3 &= 343 \\\\\nx^3 &= -343\\\\\nx &= -7.\n\\end{align*}The conjugate of $xi$ must also be a root of the quadratic, so the other root of the quadratic is $-xi$. Since the sum of these roots is $-a$, we have $-7 + 7 = -a$ which gives $a = 0$. The product $(-7)(7)$ of the roots is equal to $b$, so $b = -49$. Therefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{(0, -49)}$."}
