{"question": "In the land of Ink, the money system is unique. One Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. In Trinkets, what is the value of 56 Drinkets?", "answer": "Multiply  \\[\n3\\text{ Blinkets}=7\\text{ Drinkets}\n\\] by 8 to find that 24 Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets.  Multiply  \\[\n1\\text{ Trinkets}=4\\text{ Blinkets}\n\\] by 6 to find that $\\boxed{6}$ Trinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets (which in turn are equivalent to 56 Drinkets, as we just found).", "agents_response": "First, let's find the value of 1 Drinket in Blinkets by setting up a proportion: \n\n3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets\n1 Blinket = 7/3 Drinket\n\nNext, let's find the value of 1 Drinket in Trinkets by setting up another proportion:\n\n1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets\n1 Trinket = 4(7/3) Drinkets\n1 Trinket = 28/3 Drinkets\n\nFinally, we can find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets:\n\n56 Drinkets = 56*(28/3) Trinkets\n56 Drinkets = 16*28 Trinkets\n56 Drinkets = 448 Trinkets\n\n\\boxed{448}"}
