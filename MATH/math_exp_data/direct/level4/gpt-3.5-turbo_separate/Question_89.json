{"question": "If $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac52$, solve for $y$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.", "answer": "To begin, we observe that the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}$ is defined if and only if $y>0$. In this case, it is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{6y+2}{2y}}$. Since the quantity under the radical is always nonnegative for $y>0$, we may safely square both sides of our equation without creating fake solutions: $$\\frac{6y+2}{2y}=\\frac{25}{4}.$$Now we cross-multiply to obtain $$4(6y+2) = 25(2y),$$and solve this linear equation: \\begin{align*}\n24y+8 &= 50y \\\\\n8 &= 26y \\\\\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}} &= y\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "Multiplying both sides of the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac{5}{2}$ by $\\sqrt{2y}$ gives $\\sqrt{6y+2} = \\frac{5}{2}\\sqrt{2y}.$ Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $6y+2 = \\frac{25}{4}(2y).$ Simplifying this gives $6y+2=5y.$ Solving for $y$ gives $y = -2.$ Therefore, $\\boxed{-2}$ is the answer."}
