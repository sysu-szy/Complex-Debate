{"question": "If $a$ is a positive integer, then $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$ are also positive integers. We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.", "answer": "By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a^2+6a+9) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,3a^2+19a+30-3(a^2+6a+9)) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a+3) \\\\\n&\\qquad= a+3,\n\\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "Firstly, note that $3a^2+19a+30= (3a+10)(a+3)$ and $a^2+6a+9=(a+3)^2$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of these two expressions will be $a+3$. \n\nSo, $f(a)=a+3$. Therefore, $f(a)-a = a+3-a = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of $f(a)-a$ is $\\boxed{3}$."}
