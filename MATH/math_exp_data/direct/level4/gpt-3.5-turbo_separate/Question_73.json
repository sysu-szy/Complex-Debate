{"question": "If $a$ is a positive integer, then $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$ are also positive integers. We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.", "answer": "By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a^2+6a+9) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,3a^2+19a+30-3(a^2+6a+9)) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a+3) \\\\\n&\\qquad= a+3,\n\\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "Let's find the expression for the greatest common divisor of $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.\n\nFirst, we note that the second expression can be factored as $(a+3)^2$. We can rewrite the first expression as $3a^2 + 18a + a + 30 = 3a(a+6) + (a+6) = (3a+1)(a+6)$.\n\nNow, since the greatest common divisor is a common factor of both expressions, the greatest common divisor is $a+6$. \n\nTherefore, $f(a) = a+6$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $f(a) - a$, which simplifies to the max of $6$.\n\nSo, $\\boxed{6}$."}
