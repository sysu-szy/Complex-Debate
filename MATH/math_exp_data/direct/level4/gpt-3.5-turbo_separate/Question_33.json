{"question": "As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, what is the maximum possible value that the greatest common divisor of $13n + 8$ and $5n+3$ can take?", "answer": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here. \\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(13n+8, 5n+3) &= \\gcd(5n+3, (13n+8)-2(5n+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+3, 3n + 2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, (5n+3)-(3n+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, 2n + 1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, (3n+2)-(2n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, n+1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, (2n+1)-(n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, (n+1)-n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 1) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "The Euclidean Algorithm states that $\\text{gcd}(a,b) = \\text{gcd}(b, a \\mod b)$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Applying this property to the given values\n$\\text{gcd}(13n+8, 5n+3) = \\text{gcd}(5n+3, 3n+2)$\n$= \\text{gcd}(3n+2, 2n+1)$\n$= \\text{gcd}(2n+1, n+1)$\n$= \\text{gcd}(n+1, n) = \\text{gcd}(1, n) = 1$\n\nTherefore, the maximum value that the greatest common divisor of $13n+8$ and $5n+3$ can take is $\\boxed{1}$."}
