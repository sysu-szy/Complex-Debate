{"question": "If $10^{51} - 9$ is written as an integer in standard form, what is the sum of the integer's digits?", "answer": "Since $10^{51}$ is the least integer with $52$ digits, $10^{51}-9$ has 51 digits.  The ones digit is 1 and all the other digits are 9.  The sum of the digits is $9\\cdot 50 + 1=\\boxed{451}$.", "agents_response": "To find the sum of the integer's digits, we first need to find the value of $10^{51} - 9$.\n\n$10^{51} = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000$\n\nSubtracting $9$ from $10^{51}$, we get:\n\n$10^{51} - 9 = 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991$\n\nThe sum of the digits of this number is $8+1 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integer's digits is $\\boxed{9}$."}
