{"question": "If we flip 6 coins, what is the probability of getting at least 2 heads?", "answer": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins, we can use the complement rule. This means finding the probability of getting 0 or 1 head and subtracting it from 1.\n\nThe probability of getting 0 heads when flipping 6 coins is (1/2)^6 = 1/64\nThe probability of getting 1 head when flipping 6 coins is 6 * (1/2)^6 = 6/64 = 3/32\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins is 1 - (1/64 + 3/32) = 1 - (1/64 + 6/64) = 1 - 7/64 = 57/64.\n\n\\boxed{57/64}"}
