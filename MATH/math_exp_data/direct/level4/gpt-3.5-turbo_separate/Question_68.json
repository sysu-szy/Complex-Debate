{"question": "The sets $A = \\{z : z^{18} = 1\\}$ and $B = \\{w : w^{48} = 1\\}$ are both sets of complex roots of unity. The set $C = \\{zw : z \\in A ~ \\mbox{and} ~ w \\in B\\}$ is also a set of complex roots of unity. How many distinct elements are in $C^{}_{}$?", "answer": "Note that $\\operatorname{lcm}(18,48) = 144.$  So,\n\\[(zw)^{144} = z^{144} w^{144} = (z^{18})^8 \\cdot (w^{48})^3 = 1.\\]Hence, every element in $C$ is a 144th root of unity.\n\nConversely, consider an arbitrary 144th root of unity, say\n\\[\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi k}{144}.\\]Note that $\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (2k)}{18} \\in A$ and $\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-5k)}{48} \\in B,$ and their product is\n\\[\\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (2k)}{18} \\cdot \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-5k)}{48} = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (16k)}{144} \\cdot \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi (-15k)}{144} = \\operatorname{cis} \\frac{2 \\pi k}{144}.\\]Therefore, every 144th root of unity lies in $C,$ which means $C$ is precisely the set of 144th roots of unity.  It follows that $C$ contains $\\boxed{144}$ elements.", "agents_response": "The set $A$ contains the 18th roots of unity, which are given by $e^{i\\frac{2k\\pi}{18}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 17$. The set $B$ contains the 48th roots of unity, which are given by $e^{i\\frac{2m\\pi}{48}}$ for $m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 47$.\n\nTo find the distinct elements in set $C$, we need to find all possible products of $z\\in A$ and $w\\in B$. So we have $18 \\times 48 = 864$ possible products. However, it's worth noting that some of these products will be equal due to periodicity of trigonometric functions.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 18 and 48 is 6, so the distinct products correspond to the six different pairs of $(k, m)$ where $k$ ranges from 0 to 5 and $m$ ranges from 0 to 7. This gives us $6 \\times 8 = 48$ distinct products.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct elements in $C$ is $\\boxed{48}$."}
