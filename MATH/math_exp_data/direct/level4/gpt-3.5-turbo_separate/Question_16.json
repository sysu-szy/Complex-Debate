{"question": "The positive difference between two consecutive even perfect squares is $268$.  Compute the larger of the two squares.", "answer": "Let the larger square be $x^2$, and the smaller one be $(x-2)^2$.  Their difference is\n\n$$x^2-(x-2)^2=(x-(x-2))(x+(x-2))=2(2x-2)=4(x-1)$$Thus, $4(x-1)=268\\Rightarrow x-1=67$.\n\nSo $x=68$ and the answer is $68^2=\\boxed{4624}$.", "agents_response": "Let the two consecutive even perfect squares be $x^2$ and $(x+2)^2$.\n\nThe positive difference between the two squares is \n\\[(x+2)^2 - x^2 = 4x + 4 = 268\\]\nor $4x = 264$, which means $x = 66$. \n\nThus, the larger of the two squares is \n\\[(66+2)^2 = 68^2 = \\boxed{4624}.\\]"}
