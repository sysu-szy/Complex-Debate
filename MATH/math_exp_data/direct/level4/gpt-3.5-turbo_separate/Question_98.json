{"question": "The binary number $10101001110_{2}$ is equal to what number in base eight?", "answer": "Since $2^3=8$, we may convert between base 2 and base 8 representations by replacing each block of three digits in base 2 with its equivalent in base 8. In this case, we begin by noticing that the last three digits are worth $110_2=6_8$. The next block of three digits is $001_2=1_8$. Continuing, we find that the next two digits (moving right-to-left) are $101_2=5_8$ and $010_2=2_8$. Altogether, we find that $10101001110_{2}=\\boxed{2516_8}$.", "agents_response": "To convert a binary number to base eight (octal), we group the binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right) and then find the corresponding octal digit for each group.\n\nStarting from the right of $10101001110_{2}$:\n\n1-010-100-111-0\n\nGrouping the digits: $1$-$010$-$100$-$111$-$0$\n\nConverting each group to octal:\n$1_{2} = 1_{8}$\n$010_{2} = 2_{8}$\n$100_{2} = 4_{8}$\n$111_{2} = 7_{8}$\n$0_{2} = 0_{8}$\n\nTherefore, $10101001110_{2} = 14270_{8}$\n\n\\boxed{14270}"}
