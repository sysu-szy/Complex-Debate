{"question": "Lincoln Elementary School has 120 students. Of these 120 students, $\\frac{2}{5}$ ride the bus to school and $\\frac{5}{12}$ have a parent drive them to school. If the rest of the students walk to school, what fraction of students walk to school?", "answer": "We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\\[\\frac{120}{120} - \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{5}{12}.\\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.\n\nTo get this common denominator for the fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\\frac{48}{120}$.\n\nTo get the common denominator for $\\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \\[\\frac{120}{120} - \\frac{48}{120} - \\frac{50}{120} = \\frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \\frac{22}{120}.\\]Notice that $\\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\\frac{2\\cdot11}{2\\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{60}}$.", "agents_response": "Let $x$ be the fraction of students that walk to school. \n\nWe know that:\n$\\frac{2}{5}$ ride the bus,\n$\\frac{5}{12}$ have a parent drive them, and\n$x$ walk to school.\n\nSince the total fraction of students is 1, we have:\n$\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{5}{12} + x = 1$\n\nFinding a common denominator, we have:\n$\\frac{24}{60} + \\frac{25}{60} + x = 1$\n$\\frac{49}{60} + x = 1$\n$x = 1 - \\frac{49}{60}$\n$x = \\frac{60}{60} - \\frac{49}{60}$\n$x = \\frac{11}{60}$\n\nTherefore, the fraction of students that walk to school is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{60}}$."}
