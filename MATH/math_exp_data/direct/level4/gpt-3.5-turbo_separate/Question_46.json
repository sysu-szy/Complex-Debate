{"question": "Suppose that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. If $h(2)=10$, $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, what is $f(f(10))$?", "answer": "Since $f$ and $h$ are inverse functions and $h(2) = 10$, $f(10) = 2$, so $f(f(10)) = f(2)$.  And since $h(1) = 2$, $f(2) = \\boxed{1}$.", "agents_response": "In order to find $f(f(10))$, we will first find $f(10)$.\n\nSince $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$, we know that $h(2)=10$ implies $f(10)=2$.\n\nNext, we need to find $f(2)$ in order to find $f(f(10))$. We know that $h(1)=2$ implies $f(2)=1$.\n\nFinally, we can find $f(f(10))$ by substituting $f(10)$ into the expression $f(f(10))$ to get $f(f(10))=f(2)=\\boxed{1}$."}
