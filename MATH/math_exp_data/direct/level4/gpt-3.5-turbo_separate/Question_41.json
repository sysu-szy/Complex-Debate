{"question": "Mr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate.  After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars.  What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage?  (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)", "answer": "Let $r$ be the annual interest rate.  Then after three years, Mr. Madoff's investment is $1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3$, so \\[1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1225.\\]Then \\[\\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1.225,\\]so \\[1 + \\frac{r}{100} = \\sqrt[3]{1.225} = 1.069987 \\dots,\\]which means $r = \\boxed{7}$, to the nearest integer.", "agents_response": "Let the annual interest rate be \\( r \\) as a decimal.\n\nAfter one year, Mr. Madoff's investment grows to \\( 1000(1+r) \\).\nAfter two years, it grows to \\( 1000(1+r)^2 \\).\nAfter three years, it grows to \\( 1000(1+r)^3 = 1225 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 1000, we get:\n\\( (1+r)^3 = 1.225 \\)\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\\( 1 + r = 1.1 \\)\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\\( r = 0.1 \\)\n\nConverting \\( 0.1 \\) to a percentage, we get:\n\\( r = 10 \\% \\)\n\nTherefore, the annual interest rate is approximately \\boxed{10 \\%}."}
