{"question": "What is the largest number $c$ such that $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "In order for this quadratic to have at least one real solution, its discriminant must be non-negative. In other words, $b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(2)(c) = 25 - 8c \\ge 0$. Rearranging, we have $25 \\ge 8c$. Dividing by 8, we have $25/8 \\ge c$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ such that this quadratic has a real solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$.", "agents_response": "For the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 5x + c = 0$ to have at least one real solution, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to 0. \n\nThe discriminant is given by $b^2 - 4ac$, where $b = 5$, $a = 2$ and $c = c$. \n\nSo, we have $25 - 4(2)(c) \\geq 0$. \n\nSolving for $c$, we get $25 - 8c \\geq 0$ which simplifies to $8c \\leq 25$.\n\nTherefore, $c \\leq \\frac{25}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$."}
