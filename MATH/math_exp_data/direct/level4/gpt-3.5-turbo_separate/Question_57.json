{"question": "When Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?", "answer": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$.", "agents_response": "Let the purchase price of the house be $x$.\n\nMarika paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price with a loan, which is equal to $0.8x$.\nShe paid the remaining amount of $49,400 with her savings.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation: $0.8x + 49,400 = x$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n$0.8x + 49,400 = x$\n$49,400 = x - 0.8x$\n$49,400 = 0.2x$\n$x = \\frac{49,400}{0.2}$\n$x = 247,000$\n\nTherefore, the purchase price of Marika's house was $\\boxed{247,000}$."}
