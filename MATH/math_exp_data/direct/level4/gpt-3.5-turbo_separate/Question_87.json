{"question": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips?", "answer": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{63}{256}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}} $$", "agents_response": "We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of getting heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips.\n\nP(X \u2265 r) = \u2211 C(n,r) * p^r * (1-p)^(n-r), where C(n,r) is the binomial coefficient, p is the probability of getting heads (0.5 in this case), n is the number of flips (10 in this case), and r is the minimum number of heads.\n\nP(X \u2265 6) = C(10,6) * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^(10-6) + C(10,7) * (0.5)^7 * (0.5)^(10-7) + C(10,8) * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^(10-8) + C(10,9) * (0.5)^9 * (0.5)^(10-9) + C(10,10) * (0.5)^10 * (0.5)^(10-10)\nP(X \u2265 6) = 210 * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^4 + 120 * (0.5)^7 * (0.5)^3 + 45 * (0.5)^8 * (0.5)^2 + 10 * (0.5)^9 * (0.5) + 1 * (0.5)^10 * (0.5)^0\nP(X \u2265 6) = 0.65625\n\n\\boxed{0.65625}"}
