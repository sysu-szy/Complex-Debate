{"question": "Karla drove her vehicle 12,000 miles last year. How many gallons of gasoline would she have saved last year had she driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon rather than an SUV averaging 15 miles per gallon?", "answer": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons.", "agents_response": "First, we need to find out how many gallons of gasoline Karla consumed last year driving her SUV:\n\nNumber of gallons = Number of miles / Miles per gallon\nNumber of gallons = 12,000 miles / 15 miles per gallon\nNumber of gallons = 800 gallons\n\nIf Karla had driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon instead, she would have consumed:\n\nNumber of gallons = 12,000 miles / 48 miles per gallon\nNumber of gallons = 250 gallons\n\nBy switching to a hybrid car, Karla would have saved:\n\nAmount saved = Number of gallons saved driving SUV - Number of gallons saved driving hybrid\nAmount saved = 800 gallons - 250 gallons\nAmount saved = 550 gallons\n\nTherefore, Karla would have saved 550 gallons of gasoline last year by driving a fuel-efficient hybrid car. \n\n\\boxed{550}"}
