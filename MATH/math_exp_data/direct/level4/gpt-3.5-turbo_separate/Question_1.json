{"question": "If $0.\\overline{1331}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?", "answer": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$, so $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. As a result, $9999x = 1331$, so $x = \\frac{1331}{9999}$. We can factor out 11 out of both the numerator and denominator, so $x = \\frac{121}{909}$. Thus $a+b=121+909 = \\boxed{1030}$.", "agents_response": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$. Multiplying both sides by 10000, we have $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. Subtracting the original equation from this one, we have: \n\n\\begin{array}{r}\n10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331} \\\\ \n-x = 0.\\overline{1331} \\\\\n\\hline\n9999x = 1331\n\\end{array}\n\nTherefore, $x = \\frac{1331}{9999} = \\frac{121}{909} = \\frac{11}{83}$. \n\nThe sum of $a$ and $b$ is $11 + 83 = \\boxed{94}$."}
