{"question": "Triangle $ABC$ with vertices at $A(1, 1)$, $B(1, -2)$ and $C(5, -2)$ is translated up 3 units and then dilated with respect to the origin by a factor of 2. What are the new coordinates of point $C$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.", "answer": "After being translated, $C$ is $(5,-2+3)=(5,1)$. Dilating by a factor of 2 gives $(2 \\cdot 5, 2 \\cdot 1)=\\boxed{(10,2)}$.", "agents_response": "After translating triangle $ABC$ up 3 units, the new coordinates of $C$ would be $(5, 1)$.\n\nAfter dilating with respect to the origin by a factor of 2, the new coordinates of $C$ would be $(5 \\cdot 2, 1 \\cdot 2) = (10, 2)$.\n\nTherefore, the new coordinates of point $C$ are $\\boxed{(10, 2)}$."}
