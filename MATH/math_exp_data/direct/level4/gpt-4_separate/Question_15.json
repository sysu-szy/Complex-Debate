{"question": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?", "answer": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.", "agents_response": "There are 3 scenarios to consider based on the team composition:\n \n1. 4 girls and 2 boys\n2. 5 girls and 1 boy\n3. 6 girls and 0 boys\n \nFor the first scenario, there are C(8, 4)*C(6, 2) ways. \nFor the second scenario, there are C(8, 5)*C(6, 1) ways. \nFor the third scenario, there are C(8, 6)*C(6, 0) ways. \n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a team with more girls than boys is\n\nC(8, 4)*C(6, 2) + C(8, 5)*C(6, 1) + C(8, 6)*C(6, 0) \n\n=  70*15 + 56*6 + 28*1\n\n= 1050 + 336 + 28\n\n= 1414 ways \n\nThus, \\boxed{1414} ways to select the team with more girls than boys."}
