{"question": "If $a$ is a positive integer, then $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$ are also positive integers. We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.", "answer": "By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a^2+6a+9) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,3a^2+19a+30-3(a^2+6a+9)) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a+3) \\\\\n&\\qquad= a+3,\n\\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "First, we can factor $a^2 + 6a + 9 = (a + 3)^2$ and $3a^2 + 19a + 30 = (a + 3) * (3a + 10)$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of these two expressions is simply $a + 3$ when $a$ is an positive integer. Hence, $f(a) = a + 3$. \n\nThen, $f(a) - a = a + 3 - a = 3$. The maximum possible value of this expression is always 3, regardless of the value of $a$. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{3}."}
