{"question": "If the roots of the quadratic equation $\\frac12x^2+99x+c=0$ are $x=-99+\\sqrt{8001}$ and $x=-99-\\sqrt{8001}$, then what is the value of $c$?", "answer": "By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are $$x=\\frac{-(99)\\pm\\sqrt{(99)^2-4(\\frac12)c}}{2(\\frac12)},$$which simplifies to $$x=-99\\pm\\sqrt{9801-2c}.$$This looks like our target, except that we have to get the $9801-2c$ under the radical to equal $8001$. So, we solve the equation $9801-2c=8001$, which yields $c=\\boxed{900}$.", "agents_response": "The roots of a quadratic equation $\\frac12x^2+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nSo $\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}= \\sqrt{8001}$ from the roots given in the problem.\n\nWe must find the value of $c$ where $b=99$ and $a=1/2$.\n\nSubstitute these values in the equation: \n$\\sqrt{(99)^2-(4)(1/2)c}= \\sqrt{8001}$.\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n$(99)^2-(4)(1/2)c=  8001$.\n\nSimplify to get:\n9801-2c = 8001.\n\nSolve for $c$ to get $c= (9801-8001)/2 =  900$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is \\boxed{900}."}
