{"question": "If $a$ is a positive integer, then $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$ are also positive integers. We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.", "answer": "By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a^2+6a+9) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,3a^2+19a+30-3(a^2+6a+9)) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a+3) \\\\\n&\\qquad= a+3,\n\\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": "First factor both polynomials.  We get $(3a+5)(a+6)$ and $(a+3)^2$.  Now notice that $(3a+5)$ and $(a+3)$ share no common factors.  Therefore, for the two polynomials to share a common factors, $(a+3)$ and $(a+5)$ must share a common factor.  This only happens when $a$ is an even integer.  However, if $a$ is an even integer, then the GCD is just 2, and $f(a)-a = 2 -a$.  This is clearly not what we want to maximize.  Let's consider the case where $a$ is an odd integer.  If $a$ is odd, then $(a+3)$ and $(a+6)$ share a common factor of at most 3.  This occurs when $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.  In this case, $f(a)-a = 3 - a$.  The maximum value of $f(a) - a$ happens when $a$ is at the smallest possible value, which occurs at $a=1$ or $a=4$.  Thus, the maximum possible value of $f(a) - a$ is $\\boxed{2}$."}
