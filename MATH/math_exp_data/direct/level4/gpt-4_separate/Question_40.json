{"question": "A group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip. If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?", "answer": "We are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\\boxed{66}$.", "agents_response": "The number of students can be written in the form of $8a+5$ and $6b+3$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$. \nSetting $8a+5=6b+3$, we get $8a-6b=2$. \n\nThis is a Diophantine equation. We observe that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 6 is 2, which divides the constant term 2. Therefore, this equation has solutions. If a particular solution is $(a_0,b_0)$, then the general solution is given by \n$(a,b) = (a_0 + 3n, b_0 + 4n)$ , since 8 and 6 are multiples of 2. \n\nThis gives us the possible number of students as $N=8a+5$. We find the smallest possible $N$, given that $N$ is less than $50$. The minimum positive value of $n$ that gives a solution $N<50$ is $n=0$. We get $a_0 = 2$, $b_0 = 3$. Then our formula becomes $N=8(2+3n)+5$, or $N=16+24n$. \n\nFor $n=0$, we have $N=16$. For $n=1$, we get $N=40$. For $n=2$, we get a value greater than 50, therefore $n=2$ is not a possible solution. \n\nThe sum of possible values for $N$ is $\\boxed{56}$."}
