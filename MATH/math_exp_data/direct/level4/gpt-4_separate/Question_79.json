{"question": "How many times does the digit 8 appear in the list of all integers from 1 to 1000?", "answer": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.", "agents_response": "In the list of integers from 1 to 1000, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- 1000 times in the hundreds place\n- 100 times in the tens place for each of first 10 hundreds (100*10 = 1000 times)\n- 10 times in each set of numbers from 10-19, 20-29, \u2026 990-999, 10 times each in 100 sets (10*100 = 1000 times)\n- 10 times in the units place for each group of 8 numbers: 8,18,28,...,998 (10*100 = 1000 times)\n\nSo in total, the digit 8 appears 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = \\boxed{4000} times."}
