{"question": "Find the equation of the plane containing the points $(2,0,0),$ $(0,-5,0),$ and $(0,0,-4).$  Enter your answer in the form\n\\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,\\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D$ are integers such that $A > 0$ and $\\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.$", "answer": "The equation of the plane containing the points $(2,0,0),$ $(0,-5,0),$ and $(0,0,-4)$ is\n\\[\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{y}{5} - \\frac{z}{4} = 1.\\]Then $10x - 4y - 5z = 20,$ so the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{10x - 4y - 5z - 20 = 0}.$", "agents_response": "The equation of a plane can be written as $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{r_0}) = 0$, where $\\vec{n}$ is the normal vector to the plane and $\\vec{r_0}$ is a position vector of a point on the plane.\nWe can set $\\vec{r_0}$ to be any of the specified points, such as $(2,0,0)$.\n$\\vec{r}$ is the position vector $(x,y,z)$.\nSince $(2,0,0), (0,-5,0), (0,0,-4)$ are on the plane, so is the vector resulting from the cross product of $(2,0,0) - (0,-5,0) = (2,5,0)$ and $(2,0,0) - (0,0,-4) = (2,0,4)$. This vector, calculated as $\\vec{n} = (2,5,0) \\times (2,0,4) = (20,-8,-10)$, is orthogonal to the plane and can serve as our normal vector to the plane.\nSubstituting these values in $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{r}-\\vec{r_0}) = 0$ gives $20(x - 2) - 8y -10z = 21x - 8y - 10z - 40 = 0$\nThis answer simplifying to $21x - 8y - 10z + 40 = 0$ is divisible by $gcd(21,8,10,40) = 1$ and $21 > 0$, so it fulfills our requirements.\n\\[\\boxed{21x - 8y - 10z + 40 = 0}\\]"}
