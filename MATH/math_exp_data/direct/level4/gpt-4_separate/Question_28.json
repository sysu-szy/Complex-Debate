{"question": "If $10^{51} - 9$ is written as an integer in standard form, what is the sum of the integer's digits?", "answer": "Since $10^{51}$ is the least integer with $52$ digits, $10^{51}-9$ has 51 digits.  The ones digit is 1 and all the other digits are 9.  The sum of the digits is $9\\cdot 50 + 1=\\boxed{451}$.", "agents_response": "$10^{51} - 9$ is a very large number. However, we can see that it will be a 52 digit number because $10^{51}$ is a 52 digit number starting with 1 and followed by 51 zeros. \n\nWhen we subtract 9, we are just changing the last digit from 0 to 1 (as we are borrowing 1 from the second digit, making it 9, and deducting 9 from 10, producing a 1 in the last position). \n\nHence, we have 1 one and 51 nines. The sum is therefore $1 + 51 \\times 9 = 1 + 459 = \\boxed{460}$."}
