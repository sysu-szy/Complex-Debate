{"question": "The positive difference between two consecutive even perfect squares is $268$.  Compute the larger of the two squares.", "answer": "Let the larger square be $x^2$, and the smaller one be $(x-2)^2$.  Their difference is\n\n$$x^2-(x-2)^2=(x-(x-2))(x+(x-2))=2(2x-2)=4(x-1)$$Thus, $4(x-1)=268\\Rightarrow x-1=67$.\n\nSo $x=68$ and the answer is $68^2=\\boxed{4624}$.", "agents_response": "Suppose that the two squares are $x^2$ and $(x-2)^2$, where $x$ is an even integer. Then, \n\n$x^2 - (x - 2)^2 = 268 \\implies 4x - 4 = 268 \\implies x = 68$.\n\nThe larger square is then $68^2$, which is $\\boxed{4624}$."}
