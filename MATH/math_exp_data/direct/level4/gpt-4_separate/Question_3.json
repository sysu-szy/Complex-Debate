{"question": "If $3+\\sqrt{5}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^2 - 3x + b = 0,\\]compute $b.$", "answer": "We do not know that $b$ is rational, so we cannot conclude that the radical conjugate of $3+\\sqrt{5},$ or $3-\\sqrt{5},$ must also be a root of the equation. Instead, we turn to Vieta's formulas: the sum of the roots of the equation is $3,$ so the other root of the equation must be $3 - (3+\\sqrt5) = -\\sqrt5.$ Then $b$ equals the product of the roots: \\[b = -\\sqrt5(3+\\sqrt5) = \\boxed{-3\\sqrt5-5}.\\]Alternatively, since $3 + \\sqrt{5}$ is a root of the equation,\n\\[(3 + \\sqrt{5})^2 - 3(3 + \\sqrt{5}) + b = 0.\\]Hence, $b = \\boxed{-3 \\sqrt{5} - 5}.$", "agents_response": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 3, and the product of the roots is $b.$\n\nSince the root $3+\\sqrt{5}$ is given, the other root must be $3-\\sqrt{5}$ so that the sum of the roots is 3.\nTherefore, the product of the roots is $(3+\\sqrt{5})(3-\\sqrt{5}) = (3)^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 9 - 5 =4$.\n\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{4}.$"}
