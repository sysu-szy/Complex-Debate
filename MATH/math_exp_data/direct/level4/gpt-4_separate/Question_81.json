{"question": "Find $\\left\\lceil \\sqrt[3]{-25}\\right\\rceil$.", "answer": "We notice that $-27 = (-3)^3 < -25 < -8 = (-2)^3$. Thus, $-3 < \\sqrt[3]{-25} < -2$. The ceiling of this value will be the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt[3]{-25}$, which is $\\boxed{-2}$.", "agents_response": "The cube root of -25 is a complex number, and ceiling function is not defined for complex numbers. Therefore, the expression $\\left\\lceil \\sqrt[3]{-25}\\right\\rceil$ is undefined or it does not make sense."}
