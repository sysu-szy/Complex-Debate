{"question": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.", "answer": "The intersection of the asymptotes is $(5,7),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 2,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form\n\\[(x - 5)^2 - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = d\\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 4$ and $y = 7,$ we get $d = 1,$ so the equation is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 5)^2}{1} - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = 1.\\]Then $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 4,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 5,$ which means $c = \\sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{5}}.$", "agents_response": "The equations of asymptotes of a hyperbola with center at (h, k) and transverse and conjugate axes of lengths of 2a and 2b, respectively, are:\n\n(y - k) = \u00b1(b/a)(x - h)\n\nGiven the two asymptotes, the slope of each is \u00b12 which means that b/a is equal to \u00b12. Also note that the point where the two asymptotes intersect is the center of the hyperbola. This point of intersection is found by equating the two line equations:\n\n2x - 3 = 17 - 2x => 4x = 20 => x = 5\n\nSubstituting x = 5 in the first equation, we get:\n\ny = 2*5 - 3 = 7\n\nSo we can see that the center of the hyperbola (h, k) is (5, 7).\n\nGiven that the point (4, 7) is on the hyperbola, we can find the value of a: \n\nBecause this point (4, 7) is one unit away from the centre on the x-axis, a = 1.\n\nNow, we have b = 2a = 2.\n\nWe know that for a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is given by 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Substituting the values of a and b, we get:\n\nc^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, taking the positive square root (since distance cannot be negative), we get c = \u221a5.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2\u221a5.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}."}
