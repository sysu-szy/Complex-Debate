{"question": "A sequence of complex numbers $z_0,z_1,z_2,\\ldots$ is defined by the rule \\[\nz_{n+1}=\\frac{\\ iz_n\\ }{\\overline{z}_n},\n\\]where $\\overline{z}_n$ is the complex conjugate of $z_n$ and $i^2=-1$. Suppose that $|z_0|=1$ and $z_{2005}=1$. How many possible values are there for $z_0$?", "answer": "Note that \\[\nz_{n+1}=\\frac{iz_n}{\\overline{z}_n}=\\frac{iz_n^2}{z_n\\overline{z}_n}=\\frac{iz_n^2}{|z_n|^2}.\n\\]Since $|z_0|=1$, the sequence satisfies \\[\nz_1 = i z_0^2, \\ z_2 = iz_1^2 = i\\left(iz_0^2\\right)^2 = -iz_0^4,\n\\]and, in general, when $k\\ge 2$, \\[\nz_k = -iz_0^{2^k}.\n\\]Hence $z_0$ satisfies the equation $1 =-iz_0^{(2^{2005})}$, so $z_0^{(2^{2005})} = i.$ Because every nonzero complex number has $n$ distinct $n$th roots, this  equation has $2^{2005}$ solutions. So there are $\\boxed{2^{2005}}$ possible values for $z_0$.", "agents_response": "We start by evaluating $z_1$:\n\n$z_1= \\dfrac{i z_0}{\\overline{z_0}}$\n\nBecause $|z_0|=1$, we have $|iz_0| = |z_0| = 1$ putting it in the above equation we have:\n\n$z_1= \\dfrac{i}{\\overline{z_0}}$\n\nBoth the numerator and the denominator have the same modulus (namely 1), so their ratio also has modulus 1, i.e. $|z_1|=1$. The similar argument also applies to $z_2, z_3, z_4, \\ldots, z_{2005}$. So $|z_j| = 1$ for all $j$. \n\nNotice that the complex numbers whose modulus equal to 1 are exactly the points on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\nTaking $n=2004$ we see that $z_{2005} = \\dfrac{i}{\\overline{z_{2004}}}$ and since $z_{2005} = 1$, we have ${\\overline{z_{2004}}} = i$, on to the unit circle this means $z_{2004}$ should lie on the real axis. By convention, if $z_{2004}$ lies on the positive side of the real axis, then there should be 2 qualified $z_{2004}$, one is $z_{2004} = 1$ and the other one is $z_{2004} = -1$. If $z_{2004}$ lies on the negative side of the real axis, then there is no qualified $z_{2004}$.\n\nWe call $n_{2004}$ which denotes the number of times that the numbers $z_0, z_1, \\ldots, z_{2004}$ move around the origin and $n_{2004}$ could be negative if the numbers move in the negative direction. By the rule of constructing $z_{n+1}$, we have $n_{2004} \\bmod 2 = 0$ then $z_{2004} = 1$ and if $n_{2004} \\bmod 2 = 1$ then $z_{2004} = -1$.\n\nWe want that $z_{2004}$ is on the positive side of the real axis, by both observing the construction rule and calculating the complex numbers, following are an induction process of $z_n$:\n\n$z_{0}$: arbitrary point on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n$z_{1}$: By the construction rule $z_1 = \\frac{i}{\\overline{z_0}}$, lies on the imaginary axis. Notice if $z_0$ is on the right half plane then $z_1$ is on the upper half plane.\n\n$z_2 = \\frac{i}{\\overline{z_1}}$, lies on the real axis and since $z_1$ is on the upper half plane thus $z_2$ lies on the positive side of the real axis.\n\n$z_3 = \\frac{i}{\\overline{z_2}}$, lies on the imaginary axis and since $z_2$ is on the right half plane, thus $z_3$ lies on the lower half plane.\n\nAnd the motion repeats every 4 steps. \n\nIf $z_{2004}$ lies on the positive side of the real axis then $z_0$ lies on the right half plane. \n\nWe get $2004 \\bmod 4 = 0$. So $z_{2004} = 1$ and $z_0$ lies on the real axis. We also have $n_{2004} = 501$, but since $n_{2004} \\bmod 2 = 0$, 1 should be excluded from the answers. So $z_0$ could be any complex number on the unit circle excluding 1, and this gives us $z_0$ has \\[\\boxed{360} \\text{ possible values}\\]."}
