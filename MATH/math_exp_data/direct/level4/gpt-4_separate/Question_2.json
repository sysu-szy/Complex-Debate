{"question": "The equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 60 feet per second from a height of 54 feet from the ground, where $t$ represents time, measured in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.", "answer": "Setting $y$ to zero, we find the following: \\begin{align*}\n0& = -16t^2 - 60t + 54\\\\\n& = 16t^2 + 60t - 54\\\\\n& = 8t^2 + 30t - 27\\\\\n& = (4t-3)(2t+9)\\\\\n\\end{align*}As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \\frac{3}{4} = \\boxed{0.75}.$", "agents_response": "To find out when the ball hits the ground, we set y = 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54\n16t^2 + 60t - 54 = 0\nDividing by 2 for simplicity\n8t^2 + 30t - 27 = 0\nAfter that, you would use the quadratic formula:\nt = [-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\nGiven that a is 8, b is 30, and c is -27.\nt = {-30 \u00b1 sqrt[(30)^2 - 4*8*(-27)]} / (2*8)\nt = {-30 \u00b1 sqrt[(900) - (-864)]} / 16\nt = {-30 \u00b1 sqrt[(1764)]} / 16\nt = {-30 \u00b1 42} / 16\nSo we have two possible solutions:\nt = (30 + 42) / 16 = 72 / 16 = 4.5\nt = (30 - 42) / 16 = -12 / 16 = -0.75\nSince the time can't be negative, the ball hits the ground after 4.5 seconds.\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{4.5}."}
