{"question": "The base-10 integers 36, 64, and 81 can be converted into other bases so that their values are represented by the same digits $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$, where $\\triangle$ and $\\Box$ are two distinct digits from 0-9. What is the value of $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$?", "answer": "36, 64, and 81 are all perfect squares. That means they can all be written as $1\\cdot a^2+0\\cdot a^1+0\\cdot a^0=100_a$, where $a$ is the square root of each number. So, all three numbers can be represented by the digits $\\boxed{100}$ when converted to other bases. To see that no other digits work, note that only the bases 4, 5, and 6 use three digits to represent the number 36. (This follows from $b^2\\leq 36<b^3$, which expresses the condition that 36 has 3 digits in base $b$). The representations are $100_6$, $121_5$ and $210_4$, only one of which fits the form $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$.", "agents_response": "First, we can find the base in which the numbers are represented. We know that $36_{10}$ is equal to $100_6$, $64_{10}$ is equal to $100_8$, and $81_{10}$ is equal to $100_9$. Therefore, $\\triangle\\Box\\Box = 100$. However, we need the decimal value of this number, so $100_6 = 36_{10}$, $100_8 = 64_{10}$, and $100_9 = 81_{10}$. \n\nSo we see that these are the original values of the numbers in base 10, making the question essentially a consistency check. The initial numbers are already represented in the required form. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is \\boxed{100}."}
