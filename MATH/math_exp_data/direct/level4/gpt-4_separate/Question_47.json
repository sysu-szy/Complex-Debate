{"question": "If we flip 6 coins, what is the probability of getting at least 2 heads?", "answer": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins, we first calculate the total number of all possible outcomes, which is 2^6 = 64.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to get less than 2 heads (0 or 1).\n\nThe number of ways to get 0 heads is simply 1, as all coins must be tails.\n\nThe number of ways to get 1 head is 6, as there are 6 coins and any one of them could be the one that comes up heads.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes with less than 2 heads is 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes with at least 2 heads is 64 - 7 = 57.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is 57/64.\n\n\\boxed{57/64}."}
