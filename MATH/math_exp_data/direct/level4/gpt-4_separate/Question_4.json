{"question": "Karla drove her vehicle 12,000 miles last year. How many gallons of gasoline would she have saved last year had she driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon rather than an SUV averaging 15 miles per gallon?", "answer": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons.", "agents_response": "Karla drove 12,000 miles in a SUV that gets 15 miles per gallon, which means she used 12,000 / 15 = 800 gallons of gasoline.\nIf she drove a hybrid car that gets 48 miles per gallon, she would have used 12,000 / 48 = 250 gallons.\nSo, she would have saved 800 - 250 = \\boxed{550} gallons of gasoline."}
