{"question": "What is the largest number $c$ such that $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "In order for this quadratic to have at least one real solution, its discriminant must be non-negative. In other words, $b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(2)(c) = 25 - 8c \\ge 0$. Rearranging, we have $25 \\ge 8c$. Dividing by 8, we have $25/8 \\ge c$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ such that this quadratic has a real solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$.", "agents_response": "For the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to have at least one real solution, the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ should be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nGiven the quadratic equation $2x^2+5x+c=0$, then $a=2$, $b=5$ and without loss of generality, we can set $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ for exactly one real solution.\n\nSo we have $5^2 -4*2*c =0$, or $25 -8c=0$. Solving for $c$ gives $c=25/8$.\n\nThe largest number $c$ such that $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution is $c=25/8$. \n\nWhen simplified, $c= \\frac{25}{8}$. \n\nSo, the solution is \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}."}
