{"question": "If $f(x)=x^3$, what is the value of $f^{-1}(8)\\div (f(8))^{-1}$?", "answer": "The notation $f^{-1}(8)$ stands for a number $x$ such that $f(x)=8$ -- that is, such that $x^3=8$. The only such number is $\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\n\nThe notation $(f(8))^{-1}$ stands for $\\dfrac{1}{f(8)}$, which is equal to $\\dfrac{1}{8^3} = \\dfrac{1}{512}$.\n\nThus, $f^{-1}(8)\\div (f(8))^{-1} = 2\\div \\dfrac{1}{512} = 2\\cdot 512 = \\boxed{1024}$.", "agents_response": "First, we need to find $f^{-1}(8)$, which represents the x-value that will make $f(x)=8$. Since our function is $f(x)=x^3$, we find $f^{-1}(8)$ by solving the equation $x^3=8$. The solution to this equation is $x=2$, so $f^{-1}(8)=2$.\n\nNext, we need to find $(f(8))^{-1}$. This is equivalent to the inverse of $8^3=512$, so $(f(8))^{-1}=\\frac{1}{512}$.\n\nFinally, we divide $f^{-1}(8)$ by $(f(8))^{-1}$ to get $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{512}}=2\\times512 = 1024$.\n\nThus, $f^{-1}(8)\\div (f(8))^{-1}=\\boxed{1024}$."}
