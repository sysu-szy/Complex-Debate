{"question": "Suppose that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. If $h(2)=10$, $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, what is $f(f(10))$?", "answer": "Since $f$ and $h$ are inverse functions and $h(2) = 10$, $f(10) = 2$, so $f(f(10)) = f(2)$.  And since $h(1) = 2$, $f(2) = \\boxed{1}$.", "agents_response": "To find the value of $f(f(10))$, we first need to find the value of $f(10)$.\n\nWe know from the given information that $h(10) = 1$, and since $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, this means that $f^{-1}(10) = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 10$.\n\nNow we can find the value of $f(f(10)) = f(1) = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{10}."}
