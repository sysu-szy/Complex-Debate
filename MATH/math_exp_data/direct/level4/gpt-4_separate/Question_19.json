{"question": "Without looking at the labels, Adrien placed four CDs in four cases. What is the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$.", "agents_response": "Since each CD case is unique, there are 4! = 24 ways in which the CDs can be arranged in the cases. Out of these,\n- exactly 0 are in the right case in 9 ways,\n- exactly 1 is in the right case in 0 ways,\n- exactly 2 are in the right case in 8 ways,\n- exactly 3 are in the right case in 0 ways, and\n- exactly 4 are in the right case in 1 way.\n\nIt's clear that it's impossible for exactly 1 or 3 CDs to be in the right case (as putting one in the right case automatically puts another in the right case).\nSo the probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases is the same as the probability that exactly two CDs are in the right cases which is \\(\\frac {8} {24} = \\frac {1} {3}\\).\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}."}
