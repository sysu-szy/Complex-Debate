{"question": "The diameter of a circle is 16. By what number must the radius be decreased in order to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$?", "answer": "If the diameter of the circle is $16$, then its radius is $8$. The area of this circle is then $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (8^2) = 64 \\pi$. If we want the area of the new circle to be $48 \\pi$ less than the area of this one, then the new circle must have an area of $64 \\pi - 48 \\pi = 16 \\pi$. Now that we know the area of this circle, we can find its radius $R$ by setting $\\pi R^2$ equal to $16 \\pi$, so we have that $\\pi R^2 = 16 \\pi$ and $R = 4$.\n\nThe radius of the first circle was $8$ and the new radius is $4$, so the radius was decreased by $8-4=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "The area of a circle is $\\pi * r^2$, where r is the radius of the circle. Given that the diameter of the circle is 16, the radius of the circle, r, is $\\frac{16}{2} = 8$.\n\nSo the original area of the circle is $\\pi * 8^2 = 64\\pi$.\n\nWe want to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$, so the new area should be $64\\pi - 48\\pi = 16\\pi$.\n\nLet the new radius be x. Then the equation based on the new area is:\n\n$\\pi * x^2 =16\\pi$.\n\nSolving the equation for x:\n\n$x^2 = 16$\n\n$x = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\nSo, the radius has to be decreased by $8 - 4 = \\boxed{4}$ to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$."}
