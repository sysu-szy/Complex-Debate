{"question": "The radius of a right circular cylinder is decreased by $20\\%$ and its height is increased by $25\\%$. What is the absolute value of the percent change in the volume of the cylinder?", "answer": "Let the original radius and height be $r$ and $h$ respectively, so the original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.\n\nThe new radius and height are $\\frac{4}{5}r$ and $\\frac{5}{4}h$ respectively, so the new volume is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{5}r\\right)^2 \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\pi r^2 h$, which is $20\\%$ less than the original volume.\n\nHence the desired percent change is $\\boxed{20}$ percent.", "agents_response": "The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$ where $\\pi$ is a constant (approximately 3.14159), $r$ is the radius of the cylinder and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.\n\nLet's denote $r_0$ and $h_0$ to be the original radius and height and $r$ and $h$ to be the modified radius and height. \n\nGiven that:\n\n$r = 0.8r_0$ (which is a 20% decrease)\n\n$h = 1.25h_0$ (which is a 25% increase)\n\nWe can calculate the change in volume as follows:\n\n$\\frac {V}{V_0} = \\frac {\\pi r^2 h}{ \\pi r_0^2 h_0} = \\frac {(0.8r_0)^2 1.25h_0}{ r_0^2 h_0} = 0.8^2 * 1.25 = 0.64 * 1.25 = 0.8$\n\nSo, the new volume is 80% of the original. \n\nThe absolute value of the percent change in the volume is then $100\\% - 80\\%  = \\boxed{20\\%}$."}
