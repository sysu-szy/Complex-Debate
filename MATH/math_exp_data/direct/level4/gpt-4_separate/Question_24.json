{"question": "In the land of Ink, the money system is unique. One Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. In Trinkets, what is the value of 56 Drinkets?", "answer": "Multiply  \\[\n3\\text{ Blinkets}=7\\text{ Drinkets}\n\\] by 8 to find that 24 Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets.  Multiply  \\[\n1\\text{ Trinkets}=4\\text{ Blinkets}\n\\] by 6 to find that $\\boxed{6}$ Trinkets are equivalent to 24 Blinkets (which in turn are equivalent to 56 Drinkets, as we just found).", "agents_response": "First, we find out the value of one Drinket in Blinkets. If 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, then 1 Drinket equals 3/7 Blinkets.\n\nNow we find out the value of one Drinket in Trinkets. If 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, then 1 Blinket equals 1/4 Trinket.\n\nTherefore, 1 Drinket equals 3/7*1/4 = 3/28 Trinket.\n\nSo, the value of 56 Drinkets equals 56*3/28 = \\boxed{6} Trinkets."}
