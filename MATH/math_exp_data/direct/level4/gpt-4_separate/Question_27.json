{"question": "Find the remainder when the polynomial $x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ is divided by $x^3-4x$.", "answer": "Let $P(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ and let $Q(x)$ be the quotient when $P(x)$ is divided by $x^3-4x$. Since we are dividing by a cubic, our remainder has degree at most $2$, meaning it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$. So we have\n$$P(x) = (x^3-4x)Q(x) + ax^2+bx+c.$$Since $x^3-4x = x(x^2-4) = x(x+2)(x-2)$, we can let $x = 0 \\, , 2$, or $-2$ to make $x^3-4x =0$. Doing each of them gives us the equations:\n$$ \\begin{aligned}\n0 &= P(0) = c, \\\\\n62 &= P(2) = 4a+2b+c, \\\\\n-22 &= P(-2) = 4a-2b+c. \\end{aligned}$$Since $P(0) = 0$, we know $c=0$. This gives us $4a+2b = 62$ and $4a-2b = -22$. Solving these equations gives us $a=5$ and $b = 21$.\n\nHence the remainder is $\\boxed{5x^2+21x}$.", "agents_response": "To find the remainder when the polynomial $x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ is divided by $x^3-4x$, first express the divisor in a slightly different form. \n\nThe divisor, $x^3 - 4x$, can be rewritten as $x(x^2 - 4)$. Notice that $x^2 - 4$ is a difference of squares, which further simplifies to $x(x - 2)(x + 2)$.\n\nNow, divide the polynomial by $x$, which results in $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.\n\nAfter dividing by $x$, divide the resulting polynomial by $x - 2$ and $x + 2$.\n\nWhen we divide $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ by $x - 2$, by long division or synthetic division, the remainder is 15.\n\nSimilarly, when we divide $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ by $x + 2$, the remainder is -3.\n\nNext, apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem: \n\nLet $n$ be the integer such that $n \u2261 15 \\pmod {x - 2}$ and $n \u2261 -3 \\pmod {x + 2}$. \n\nSolving $n \u2261 15 \\pmod {x - 2}$ and $n \u2261 -3 \\pmod {x + 2}$ simultaneously gives us: \n\n$ n = 15 + k (x - 2) = -3 + m(x + 2) $.\n\nThis gives us $ k = m = 1 $ when $ x = 1$. \n\nTherefore, $ n = 15 + k = 16 $.\n\nHence, the remainder when the polynomial $x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ is divided by $x^3 - 4x$ is the constant 16. \n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{16}."}
