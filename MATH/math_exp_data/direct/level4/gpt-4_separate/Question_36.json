{"question": "Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, and let \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{a}{b}x & \\text{ if }x\\le-4, \\\\\nabx^2 & \\text{ if }x>-4.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]If $f(-4)=-\\frac{60}{13}$ and $f(4)=3120$, what is $a+b$?", "answer": "Since $-4\\le-4$, we know that $f(-4)=\\frac{a}{b}(-4)=-\\frac{60}{13}$. So, $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{15}{13}$. Next we look at $4>-4$, so $f(4)=ab\\cdot4^2=3120$. That means $ab=\\frac{3120}{16}=195$. Now that we have two equations and two variables, we can solve for $a$ and $b$. From $ab=195$, we get that $a=\\frac{195}{b}$. We substitute this value for $a$ into the equation $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{15}{13}$ to get $\\frac{195}{b^2}=\\frac{15}{13}$.\n\nNext we cross-multiply and get $15b^2=13\\cdot195$. Before multiplying 13 by 195, we try factoring 195 and notice that 15 is a factor of 195, so we can rewrite this as $15b^2=13\\cdot13\\cdot15$. Finally, $b^2=13^2$, so $b=\\pm13$. The problem says that $a$ and $b$ are positive, so $b=13$ and $a=\\frac{195}{13}=15$. The sum $a+b$ equals $\\boxed{28}$.", "agents_response": "Substituting $x=-4$ into $f(x)$, we get $-\\frac{4a}{b}= -\\frac{60}{13}$, which can be solved to $a = \\frac{60b}{13}$.\nSubstituting $x=4$ into $f(x)$, we get $16ab=3120$, which can be solved to $b=\\frac{195}{a}$.\nBy substituting $b = \\frac{195}{a}$ into $a = \\frac{60b}{13}$, we get $a=\\frac{60*195}{13*a} \\Rightarrow a^2 = 900 \\Rightarrow a = 30$ (taking the positive value of a because given a and b are positive numbers).\nSubstituting $a =30$ into $b = \\frac{195}{a}$, we get $b=6.5$. \nSum of a and b is $30 + 6.5 = 36.5$ so the final answer is $\\boxed{36.5}$."}
