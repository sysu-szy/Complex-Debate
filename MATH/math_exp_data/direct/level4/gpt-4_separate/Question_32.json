{"question": "Let $x=\\frac{7}{8}$ and $y=-\\frac{2}{9}$.  If $x\\cdot z = y$, then what is $z$?", "answer": "Plug in the values of $y$ and $x$, we have $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot z = -\\frac{2}{9}$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{7}{8}$, we have $z = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{7}{8}}$.  Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $x = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} = \\frac{-2\\cdot8}{9\\cdot7}$ = $\\boxed{-\\frac{16}{63}}$.", "agents_response": "From the equation $x\\cdot z = y$, we know $z= y/x$. \n\nBy plugging in the given values, we get that $z=-\\frac{2}{9}/\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nBy simplifying that, $z=\\frac{-2}{9}\\cdot\\frac{8}{7} = \\frac{-16}{63}$. \n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{16}{63}}$."}
