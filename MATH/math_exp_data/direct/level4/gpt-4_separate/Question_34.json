{"question": "What is the least common multiple of all positive integers smaller than 8?", "answer": "We write out the prime factorization of all natural numbers smaller than 8: \\[1, \\: 2, \\: 3, \\: 2^2, \\: 5, \\: 2 \\cdot 3, \\: 7.\\]Multiplying the highest power of each prime number together yields a desired least common multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{420}$.", "agents_response": "The positive integers smaller than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The least common multiple of these numbers is 420. Thus, the answer is \\boxed{420}."}
