{"question": "Find the remainder when the polynomial $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x$ is divided by $x^3-x$.", "answer": "Since $x^3-x = x(x^2-1) = x(x+1)(x-1)$ has degree $3$, we know that the remainder is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the quotient be $q(x)$. Then,\n$$x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x =x(x+1)(x-1)q(x) +  ax^2+bx+c.$$If we plug in $x=0$, we get $c=0$. If we plug in $x=1$, we get $5 = a+b$. And if we plug in $x=-1$ we get $-1= a-b$.\nSolving these two equations together gives us $a=2$ and $b=3$ which means the remainder is $\\boxed{2x^2+3x}$.", "agents_response": "The polynomial $x^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1) = x(x + 1)(x - 1)$, so any polynomial divisible by $x^3 - x$ must be divisible by $x$, $x + 1$, and $x - 1$. The remainders when $x^{18} + x^{13} + x^7 + x^4 + x$ is divided by $x$, $x + 1$, and $x - 1$ must all be $0$. \n\nWhen dividing by $x$, the remainder is $0$. \n\nWhen plugging in $x = -1$, we get $(-1)^{18} + (-1)^{13} + (-1)^7 + (-1)^4 + (-1) = 1-1-1+1-1 = -1$\n\nWhen plugging in $x = 1$, we get $1^{18} + 1^{13} + 1^7 + 1^4 + 1 = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5$\n\nTherefore, $5$ and $-1$ are also remainders when the polynomial is divided by $x^3 - x$, which contradicts the fact that the remainder must be $0$ in all three cases. \n\nThis suggests that there is no remainder, meaning that the given polynomial is divisible by $x^3 - x$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{0}."}
