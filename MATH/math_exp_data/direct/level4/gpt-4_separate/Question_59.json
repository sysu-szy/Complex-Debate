{"question": "The first and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are $\\frac23$ and $\\frac45$, respectively. What is the fifth term?", "answer": "Since the fifth term is halfway between the first term and ninth term, it is simply the average of these terms, or \\[\\frac{2/3 + 4/5}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}.\\]", "agents_response": "The ninth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found by the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. \n\nWe can substitute the given values into this formula: $\\frac45 = \\frac23 + (9-1)d$.\n\nNext we simplify the right side of the equation: $\\frac45 = \\frac23 + 8d$.\n\nNow, in order to isolate $d$, we can subtract $\\frac23$ from both sides of the equation: $\\frac45 - \\frac23 = 8d$.\n\nSubtracting $\\frac23$ from $\\frac45$ gives $\\frac{8}{15}$, so the equation is now $\\frac{8}{15} = 8d$.\n\nThen, to find $d$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8: $d = \\frac{8}{15} \\div 8 = \\frac{8}{120} = \\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nNow that we have the common difference (d), we can find the fifth term ($a_5$) of the sequence using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again:\n\n$a_5 = \\frac23 + (5-1)\\cdot\\frac{1}{15} = \\frac23 + \\frac{4}{15} = \\frac{30}{45} + \\frac{12}{45} = \\frac{42}{45} = \\frac{14}{15}$.\n\nTherefore, the fifth term of the sequence is $\\frac{14}{15}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{14}{15}}."}
