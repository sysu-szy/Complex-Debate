{"question": "If $0.\\overline{1331}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?", "answer": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$, so $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. As a result, $9999x = 1331$, so $x = \\frac{1331}{9999}$. We can factor out 11 out of both the numerator and denominator, so $x = \\frac{121}{909}$. Thus $a+b=121+909 = \\boxed{1030}$.", "agents_response": "To express the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{1331}$ as a fraction, we can set it equal to a variable $x$ and subtract equations to eliminate the repeating part:\n\nLet $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$. Then $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$.\n\nTherefore, subtracting $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$ from $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$ gives $9999x = 1331$, or $x = \\frac{1331}{9999}$.\n\nSince $1331$ and $9999$ have a common factor of $37$, we divide both numerator and denominator by $37$ to reduce the fraction to lowest terms: $x = \\frac{1331/37}{9999/37} = \\frac{36}{270}$.\n\nThis can be simplified further to $x = \\frac{36/90}{270/90} = \\frac{2}{15}$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $18$.\n\nSo, $a = 2$ and $b = 15$ are the positive integers that express $0.\\overline{1331}$ as a fraction in lowest terms, and their sum is $a + b = 2 + 15 = 17$.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{17}."}
