{"question": "Mr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate.  After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars.  What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage?  (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)", "answer": "Let $r$ be the annual interest rate.  Then after three years, Mr. Madoff's investment is $1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3$, so \\[1000 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1225.\\]Then \\[\\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{100} \\right)^3 = 1.225,\\]so \\[1 + \\frac{r}{100} = \\sqrt[3]{1.225} = 1.069987 \\dots,\\]which means $r = \\boxed{7}$, to the nearest integer.", "agents_response": "To solve this problem, you need to use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest,\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money),\n- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year,\n- t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, we know that:\n\n- A = $1225,\n- P = $1000,\n- n = 1 (since the investment is compounded annually),\n- t = 3 years.\n\nWe are solving for r. Therefore we simplify the formula to 1225 = 1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3), which simplifies to 1225 = 1000(1 + r)^3.\n\nThis allows us to solve for r, which comes out as 0.07 or 7%. \n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{7}."}
