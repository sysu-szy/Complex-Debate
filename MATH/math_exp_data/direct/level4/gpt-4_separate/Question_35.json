{"question": "Find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers for which $x^2+ax+b$ has a non-real root whose cube is $343$.", "answer": "We want $x$ to satisfy $x^3 = 343.$  Then $x^3 - 343 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 7)(x^2 + 7x + 49) = 0.$  Thus, $(a,b) = \\boxed{(7,49)}.$", "agents_response": "If a quadratic polynomial has a non-real root, then its discriminant is less than $0$. The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b=0$ are $-\\frac{a}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4}-b}$, where the discriminant is $\\frac{a^2}{4}-b$. \n\nTo have a non-real root, we must have $\\frac{a^2}{4}-b<0$. Since one of the roots is a non-real number whose cube is $343$, this root could either be $\\sqrt[3]{343}$ or $-\\sqrt[3]{343}$. \n\nLet's set the non-real root as $r=\\sqrt[3]{343}$, then the other root will be its complex conjugate $\\bar{r}$. Since the cube root of $343$ equals to $7$, so $r=7i$ and $\\bar{r}=-7i$. \n\nThe sum of the roots equals to $-\\frac{a}{1}=-a$, and the product of the roots equals to $\\frac{b}{1}=b$. Therefore, we have: \n\n$r+\\bar{r}=7i-7i=0=-a$\n\n$r\\bar{r}=(7i)(-7i)=49=b$.\n\nSolving the above system of equations yields $a=0$ and $b=49$. \n\nSo the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{(0,49)}$."}
