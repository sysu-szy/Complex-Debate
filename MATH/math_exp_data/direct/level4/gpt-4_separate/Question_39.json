{"question": "Find the radius of the circle with equation $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0$.", "answer": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 49 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49$. It follows that the square of the radius is 49, so the radius must be $\\boxed{7}$.", "agents_response": "The equation of a circle can be represented in the standard form as $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. \n\nTo convert the given equation into standard form, we will complete the square for each variable separately.\n\n$x^2 - 4x + ____ + y^2 - 6y + ____ = 36 + ____ + ____$\n\nFor the x terms, we take half of -4, square it and add it to both sides. This yields 4.\n\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + _____ = 36 + 4 + _____$\n\nFor the y terms, we take half of -6, square it, and add it to both sides. This will give us 9.\n\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 36 + 4 + 9$\n\nSimplifying, the equation becomes,\n\n$(x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 49$\n\nNow the equation is in standard form, which shows us that radius r is the square root of 49.\n\n^The final answer is \\boxed{7}."}
