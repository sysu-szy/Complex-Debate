{"question": "If $$\\begin{array}{@{}l@{\\;}l@{}l@{}l} && & P_b \\\\ & \\times & & P_b \\\\ \\cline{2-4} & & 3 & 1_b, \\\\ \\end{array} $$where $P$ and $b$ represent two distinct digits 0-9 and $P$ is one less than $b$, what is the value of the base $b$?", "answer": "We can rewrite $31_b$ as $3b+1$ in base 10. So, we have $P\\cdot P=3b+1$. The value of $P$ is one less than $b$, so we substitute $(b-1)$ for $P$ and get \\begin{align*}\n(b-1)^2&=3b+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-2b+1&=3b+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-5b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb(b-5)&=0.\n\\end{align*}That means $b=0$ or $b=5$, but a base of 0 would mean $P=-1$ and the multiplication problem would not be true. So, the base $b$ is $\\boxed{5}$.", "agents_response": "In order for $P$ to be one less than $b$, $b$ must be at least 2 (since we are in base $b$, and $P$ cannot be negative). We are operating in base $b$, so $3_b = 3$ in base ten, and $1_b = 1$ in base ten. To compute the product $P_b \\times P_b$ in base $b$ we actually perform the multiplication in base ten and convert the result to base $b$. The number $P_b$ in base ten is $b+P$.\n\nBecause $P = b - 1$, this means that $P_b = 2b - 1$ in base ten. The product $(2b - 1)_{10} \\times (2b - 1)_{10}$ must equal to $31_b$, which is equal to $3b + 1$ in base ten. Therefore for the given problem, we have $(2b - 1)^2 = 3b + 1$.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we have $4b^2 - 4b + 1 = 3b + 1$, which simplifies to $4b^2 - 7b = 0$. Factoring out $b$ yields $b(4b - 7) = 0$, so $b = 0$ or $b = 7/4$.\n\nHowever, $b$ must be a whole number, so $b \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 7/4$. The only possible integer solution is $b = \\boxed{7}$."}
