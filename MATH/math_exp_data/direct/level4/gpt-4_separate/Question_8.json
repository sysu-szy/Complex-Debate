{"question": "Let $x=\\frac{7}{8}$ and $y=-\\frac{2}{9}$.  If $x\\cdot z = y$, then what is $z$?", "answer": "Plug in the values of $y$ and $x$, we have $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot z = -\\frac{2}{9}$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{7}{8}$, we have $z = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{9}}{\\frac{7}{8}}$.  Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $x = -\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} = \\frac{-2\\cdot8}{9\\cdot7}$ = $\\boxed{-\\frac{16}{63}}$.", "agents_response": "We have the equation $x\\cdot z = y$. We can solve for $z$ by rearranging the equation to get $z = \\frac{y}{x}$.\n\nNow, substitute values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation to find $z$. That is, $z = \\frac{-2/9}{7/8}$.\nSimplify this fraction, and you get $z= \\frac{-2/8}{7/9} = \\frac{-1/4}{7/9}$. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we have $z = \\frac{-1/4}{1} \\cdot \\frac{9/7} = \\frac{-9}{28}$ .\n\nSo, $z = \\boxed{-\\frac{9}{28}}."}
