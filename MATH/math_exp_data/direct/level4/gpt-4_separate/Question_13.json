{"question": "Suppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books. In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?", "answer": "We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$", "agents_response": "First, we consider the ways we can place the $4$ non-math books. There are $4! = 24$ ways to do this. \n\nNext, we consider the spaces between and on the sides of these books, where we can place the math books. With $4$ non-math books, there are $5$ such spaces. \n\nWe do not want the math books to be next to each other, so we need to select $2$ of these spaces in which to place the math books. There are $5$ ways to choose the first space and $4$ ways to choose the second, giving us $5*4 = 20$ ways altogether to do this.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted: for each pair of spaces we have chosen, we have counted it twice (once for each order the spaces could be chosen in). Therefore, we divide by $2$ to get the actual number of ways to choose the spaces, which is $20/2 = 10$.\n\nFinally, there are $2! = 2$ ways to place the math books in these spaces.\n\nMultiplying everything together gives us the total number of ways to place the books: $24 * 10 * 2 = 480$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{480}$."}
