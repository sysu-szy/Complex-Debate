{"question": "A parabola has vertex of $(4,-5)$ and has two $x$-intercepts, one positive, and one negative.  If this parabola is the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c,$ which of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be positive?\n\nEnter the coefficients that must be positive, separated by commas.  For example, if you think $a$ and $c$ must be positive, enter \"$a,$ $c$\", without the quotation marks.", "answer": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$", "agents_response": "The vertex $(4,-5)$ of the parabola tells us that the quadratic is in the form\n\\[y = a(x - 4)^2 - 5\\]for a positive $a.$  (If $a$ were negative, it would have been the minimum, not the maximum.)  The two $x$-intercepts mean that $y = a(x - r)(x - s)$ for some numbers $r$ and $s.$  Writing everything in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c,$ we get\n\\[y = a \\left( x^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{r + s}{2} x + \\frac{r^2 + s^2 - 20}{4} \\right) = ax^2 + bx + c,\\]so $a > 0$ and $c = a \\left( \\frac{r^2 + s^2 - 20}{4} \\right) < 0.$  Hence, the coefficients that must be positive are $\\boxed{a}.$"}
