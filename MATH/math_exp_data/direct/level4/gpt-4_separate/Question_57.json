{"question": "When Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?", "answer": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$.", "agents_response": "The $80\\%$ of the purchase price that Marika paid with a loan represents $100\\%-20\\%=80\\%$ of the total purchase price. Therefore, the remaining $20\\%$ of the purchase price is $\\$49,400$.\nTo find the full price, we need to figure out what amount $\\$49,400$ represent $20\\%$ of. \nWe set up the equation $0.20x = \\$49,400$, and solve for $x$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $0.20$ gives us $x = \\$49,400 / 0.20 = \\$247,000$.\nSo, the purchase price of Marika's house was \\boxed{\\$247,000}."}
