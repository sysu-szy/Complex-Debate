{"question": "In the figure shown, a perpendicular segment is drawn from B in rectangle ABCD to meet diagonal AC at point X.  Side AB is 6 cm and diagonal AC is 10 cm.  How many centimeters away is point X from the midpoint M of the diagonal AC?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(25,0)--(25,15)--(0,15)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(25,15),linewidth(1));\ndraw((7.2,4.3)--(0,15),linewidth(1));\ndot((12.5,7.5));\nlabel(\"$M$\",(12.5,7.5),N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,15),N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(25,15),N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(25,0),S);\nlabel(\"$X$\",(7.2,4.3),SE);\n[/asy]", "answer": "We see that $\\triangle ABX \\sim \\triangle ACB$ since $\\angle BXA = \\angle ABC$ and $\\angle A$ is shared by both triangles. From this similarity, we have the equation $\\frac{AB}{AC}=\\frac{AX}{AB}$. Plugging in the known values of the sides and solving for $AX$, we have $\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{AX}{6}\\Rightarrow AX=3.6$. Since $AM=10/2=5$, $XM=5-3.6=\\boxed{1.4}$ centimeters.", "agents_response": "This is a solution that uses the Pythagorean Theorem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB = DC. We are given that AB = 6 cm, so DC = 6 cm. Triangle XDC is a right triangle, so if we denote the length CX = x cm, then DX = 8 cm by the Pythagorean Theorem.  Since DM = MC = AC/2 = 5 cm, then MX = DM - DX = 5 cm - 8 cm = \\boxed{-3 cm}."}
