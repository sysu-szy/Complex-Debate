{"question": "If $\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}}=\\frac32$, solve for $x$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.", "answer": "We can start by cross-multiplying: \\begin{align*} 3\\sqrt{3x-1}&=2\\sqrt{2x}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad (3\\sqrt{3x-1})^2 &=(2\\sqrt{2x})^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 9(3x-1)& =4(2x)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 27x-9& =8x\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad19x&=9\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\boxed{\\frac9{19}}.\n\\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ does indeed work, so it is not an extraneous solution.", "agents_response": "To solve the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt{2x}}{\\sqrt{3x-1}}=\\frac32$, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.\n\nDoing so, we get: $\\frac{2x}{3x-1}= \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nCross multiply to get rid of the fraction, we have $2x*4=9*(3x-1)$.\n\nSimplify to get $8x = 27x -9$.\n\nMove all terms with $x$ to one side and constants to another side: $19x = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is: $x = \\frac{9}{19}$.\n\nThus, \\boxed{\\frac{9}{19}} is the solution."}
