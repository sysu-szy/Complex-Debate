{"question": "If $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac52$, solve for $y$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.", "answer": "To begin, we observe that the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}$ is defined if and only if $y>0$. In this case, it is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{6y+2}{2y}}$. Since the quantity under the radical is always nonnegative for $y>0$, we may safely square both sides of our equation without creating fake solutions: $$\\frac{6y+2}{2y}=\\frac{25}{4}.$$Now we cross-multiply to obtain $$4(6y+2) = 25(2y),$$and solve this linear equation: \\begin{align*}\n24y+8 &= 50y \\\\\n8 &= 26y \\\\\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}} &= y\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "We can start solving the equation by squaring both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}\\right)^2$ = $\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{6y+2}{2y}$ = $\\frac{25}{4}$\n\nSolving the equation further:\n\n$6y + 2 = \\frac{25}{2} * 2y$\n\n$6y + 2= 25y$\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\n$6y=25y -2$\n\nSubtracting 25y from both sides;\n\n$6y-25y=-2$\n\n$-19y=-2$\n\nDividing by -19:\n\n$y=\\frac{2}{19}$\n\nSo, \\boxed{\\frac{2}{19}} is the solution to the given equation."}
