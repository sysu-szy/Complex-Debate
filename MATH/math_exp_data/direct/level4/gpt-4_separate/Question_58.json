{"question": "Simplify $\\sqrt{720}$.", "answer": "We need to factor out squares from 720. First we check $2^2=4$. $$720=4\\cdot180=4\\cdot4\\cdot45$$Next we check $3^2=9$. $$45=9\\cdot5$$It's obvious that 5 has no square factors (besides 1) since it is prime. So, $\\sqrt{720}=\\sqrt{4\\cdot4\\cdot9\\cdot5}=2\\cdot2\\cdot3\\sqrt{5}=\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}$.", "agents_response": "We can simplify $\\sqrt{720}$ by breaking it down into primes. \n\nThe prime factorization of $720$ is $2^4*3^2*5$, so $\\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4*3^2*5} = 2^2*3*\\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nSo, the simplified form of $\\sqrt{720}$ is \\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}."}
