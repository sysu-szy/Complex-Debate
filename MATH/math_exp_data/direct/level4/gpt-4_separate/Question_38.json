{"question": "What is the average of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ if the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7 and the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8?", "answer": "We can rephrase the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2} &= 7\\\\\n\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 8\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2}+\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 7+8\\\\\n\\frac{2a+2b+2c}{2} &= 15\\\\\na+b+c &= 15\\\\\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3} &= \\frac{15}{3} = \\boxed{5}\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "The average of $a$ and $2b$ can be written as \n\n$\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$ \n\nMultiplying each side by 2 gives \n\n$a+2b=14$  -----(1)\n\nSimilarly, the average of $a$ and $2c$ can be written as \n\n$\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$ \n\nMultiplying each side by 2 gives \n\n$a+2c=16$  -----(2)\n\nSo, the average of integers a, b and c can be written as \n\n$\\frac{a+b+c}{3}$\n\nWe can find this by adding equations (1) and (2), then subtracting a from both sides to isolate b + c:\n\n$b + c = (14 + 16 - a) / 2 = 15 - a/2$\n\nAnd so, substituting this into our average gives \n\n$\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = \\frac{2a + 30 - a}{6} = \\frac{a+30}{6} = \\frac{a}{6} + 5$\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{a}{6} + 5}."}
