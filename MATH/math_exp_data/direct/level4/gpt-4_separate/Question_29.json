{"question": "Find all real values of $t$ which satisfy \\[\\frac{t(2t-3)}{4t-2} \\le 0.\\]", "answer": "Let $f(t) = t(2t-3)/(4t-2).$ We make a sign table for each of the three factors on the left-hand side:\n\\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$t$ &$2t-3$ &$4t-2$ &$f(t)$ \\\\ \\hline$t<0$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$0<t<\\frac{1}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$\\frac{1}{2}<t<\\frac{3}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$t>\\frac{3}{2}$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Therefore, we have $f(t) < 0$ when $t < 0$ or $\\tfrac12 < t < \\tfrac32.$ Because the inequality is non-strict, we must also include the values of $t$ for which $f(t) = 0,$ which are $t=0$ and $t =\\tfrac32.$ Putting all this together, we get that the set of solutions for $t$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0] \\cup (\\tfrac12, \\tfrac32]}.$", "agents_response": "Firstly, we rewrite the inequality as $\\frac{t(2t-3)}{2(2t-1)} \\le 0$. \n\nSetting each part of the fraction to $0$, we find that $t=0$, $t=\\frac{3}{2}$, and $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ are all points where the function changes sign. \n\nBetween each of these values, the sign will remain constant, so we choose test points to compare:\n\nCompare $t<0$, $0<t<\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{2}<t<\\frac{3}{2}$, and $\\frac{3}{2}<t$.\n\nFor $t<0$, all parts of the inequality are positive, so the inequality is greater than $0$.\n\nFor $0<t<\\frac{1}{2}$, $t$ is positive, $(2t-3)$ is negative, and $(2t-1)$ is negative. Since there are an odd number of negatives, the overall inequality is negative, and therefore less than $0$.\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{2}<t<\\frac{3}{2}$, $t$ is positive, $(2t-3)$ is negative, and $(2t-1)$ is positive. Since there is one negative, the overall inequality is negative, and therefore less than $0$.\n\nFor $\\frac{3}{2}<t$, all parts of the inequality are positive, so the inequality is greater than $0$.\n\nHence, the solutions to the inequality are when $0\\le t\\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and when $\\frac{1}{2}<t<\\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{0\\le t<\\frac{3}{2}}. Note that we do not include $\\frac{1}{2}$ because $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ makes the original inequality undefined."}
