{"question": "Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?", "answer": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$.", "agents_response": "Let's denote with t the time Mike traveled before they met. Then Josh traveled for 2t. If Mike traveled with the speed v, then Josh traveled with the speed 4v/5.\n\nWhen they met, they covered together a distance of 13 miles. The distance is the product of time and speed, so they traveled together for:\n\nt * v + 2t * (4v/5) = 13,\nwhich leads to:\nv * t + (8/5) * v * t = 13,\nor\n(18/5) * v * t = 13,\nwhich leads to:\nv * t = (65/18) miles, or about 3.6111111 miles.\n\nSo, Mike rode for \\boxed{3.6111111} miles before they met."}
