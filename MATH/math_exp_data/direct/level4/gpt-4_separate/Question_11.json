{"question": "What is the area, in square units, of the square with the four vertices at $(-2, 2), (2, -2), (-2, -6)$, and $(-6, -2)$?", "answer": "The length of the square is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{32}$.", "agents_response": "The distance between the points $(-2, 2)$ and $(2, -2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Substituting the given points into the formula gives $\\sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe area of the square is then the side length squared, which is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4^2 * (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 * 2 = 32$ square units.\n\nSo the area of the square is \\boxed{32}."}
