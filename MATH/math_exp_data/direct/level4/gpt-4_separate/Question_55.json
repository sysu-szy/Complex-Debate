{"question": "If $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}=\\frac52$, solve for $y$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.", "answer": "To begin, we observe that the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}}$ is defined if and only if $y>0$. In this case, it is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{6y+2}{2y}}$. Since the quantity under the radical is always nonnegative for $y>0$, we may safely square both sides of our equation without creating fake solutions: $$\\frac{6y+2}{2y}=\\frac{25}{4}.$$Now we cross-multiply to obtain $$4(6y+2) = 25(2y),$$and solve this linear equation: \\begin{align*}\n24y+8 &= 50y \\\\\n8 &= 26y \\\\\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}} &= y\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "The first step is to square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root symbols. \n\nSo you have $(\\frac{\\sqrt{6y+2}}{\\sqrt{2y}})^2 =(\\frac{5}{2})^2$.\n\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{6y+2}{2y} = \\frac{25}{4}$,\n\nMultiplying both sides by $2y$, we get $6y+2 = \\frac{50y}{4}$.\n\nRearranging gives $6y - \\frac{50y}{4} = -2$.\n\nMultiply through by 4 to clear the fraction, giving $24y - 50y = -8$,\n\nSimplifying gives $-26y = -8$,\n\nSo $y = \\frac{8}{26} = \\frac{4}{13}$.\n\nTherefore, $y = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}$."}
