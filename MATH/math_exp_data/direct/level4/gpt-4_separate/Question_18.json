{"question": "Voldemort bought $6.\\overline{6}$ ounces of ice cream at an ice cream shop. Each ounce cost $\\$0.60.$ How much money, in dollars, did he have to pay?", "answer": "First let's convert $6.\\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=6.\\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=66.\\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $66.\\overline{6}$ and $6.\\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=60$, which implies $p=20/3$. As we know, $0.60 = 6/10=3/5$. We multiply the two fractions to get $$\\frac{\\cancelto{4}{20}}{\\cancel{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\cancel{3}}{\\cancel{5}} = 4.$$Voldemort had to pay $\\boxed{\\$4}$ for the ice cream.", "agents_response": "In order to determine the amount of money Voldemort had to pay, you simply need to multiply the number of ounces of ice cream he bought by the cost per ounce. \n\n$6.\\overline{6} * \\$0.60 = \\$4$\n\nSo, Voldemort had to pay \\boxed{4} dollars for the ice cream."}
