{"question": "As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, what is the maximum possible value that the greatest common divisor of $13n + 8$ and $5n+3$ can take?", "answer": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here. \\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(13n+8, 5n+3) &= \\gcd(5n+3, (13n+8)-2(5n+3)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+3, 3n + 2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, (5n+3)-(3n+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(3n+2, 2n + 1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, (3n+2)-(2n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(2n+1, n+1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, (2n+1)-(n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n+1, n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, (n+1)-n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 1) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "The Euclidean algorithm is often used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd). It states that for a > b, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b).\n\nUsing the algorithm, gcd(13n+8, 5n+3) = gcd(5n+3, (13n+8) mod (5n+3)), which simplifies to gcd(5n+3, 3n+2) by the division algorithm. \n\nRepeating the algorithm, gcd(5n+3, 3n+2) = gcd(3n+2, (5n+3) mod (3n+2)) = gcd(3n+2, 2n+1). \n\nFinally, gcd(3n+2, 2n+1) = gcd(2n+1, (3n+2) mod (2n+1)), which reduces to gcd(2n+1, n+1).\n\nApply the algorithm one more time and get gcd(2n+1, n+1) = gcd(n+1, (2n+1) mod (n+1)) = gcd(n+1, n), indicating that the greatest common divisor could only be at most n+1.\n\nFor the given set of positive integers, the maximum value of gcd is achieved when n=1, which makes the gcd=2. Hence, the maximum possible value is \\boxed{2}."}
