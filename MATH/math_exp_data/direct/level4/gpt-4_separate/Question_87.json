{"question": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips?", "answer": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{63}{256}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}} $$", "agents_response": "The total number of outcomes from flipping a coin 10 times is 2^10 = 1024. \n\nThe number of successful outcomes (flipping at least 6 heads) is given by the sum of the number of ways to flip exactly 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads. These are given by the combination formula \"10 choose k\", for k = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. \n\n10 choose 6 = 210\n10 choose 7 = 120\n10 choose 8 = 45\n10 choose 9 = 10\n10 choose 10 = 1\n\nSumming these gives 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 386 successful outcomes.\n\nSo the probability of getting at least 6 heads when flipping a fair coin 10 times is 386/1024, which simplifies to 193/512. \n\nSo, \\boxed{193/512}."}
