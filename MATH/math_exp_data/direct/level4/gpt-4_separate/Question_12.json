{"question": "Give the greatest common divisor of $6^3$ and $3^6$.", "answer": "We notice that $6^3 = (2 \\cdot 3)^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3$. Since $2$ does not divide $3^6$, we only need to consider powers of $3$. Indeed, $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ is the highest power of $3$ which divides both numbers, so it is the greatest common divisor.", "agents_response": "The greatest common divisor of $6^3$ and $3^6$ is $3^3$. \nSo, the answer is \\boxed{27}."}
