{"question": "There are $4$ separate large boxes, and inside each large box there are $3$ separate small boxes, and inside each of these small boxes there are $2$ separate smaller boxes. How many boxes, counting all sizes, are there altogether?", "answer": "$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Type of Box} & \\textbf{Large} & \\textbf{Small} & \\textbf{Smaller} & \\textbf{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Number} & 4 & 12 & 24 & 40 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$ Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{40}.$", "agents_response": "In each large box, there are $1$ (the original large box) + $3$ (the small boxes in the large box) + $3*2$ (the smaller boxes in each of the small boxes) = $1 + 3 + 6 = 10$ boxes. \n\nSo, in $4$ large boxes, there are $4*10 = 40$ boxes in total.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{40}.$"}
