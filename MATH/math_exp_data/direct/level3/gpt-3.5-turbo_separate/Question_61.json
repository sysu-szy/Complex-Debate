{"question": "In any month with a Friday the Thirteenth, what day of the week is the first day of the same month?", "answer": "If the 13th is a Friday, then the 14th is a Saturday, and the 15th is a Sunday.  Subtracting 14 days (which is two weeks), we find that the first of the month is also a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.", "agents_response": "Since there are always 7 days in a week, the day of the week that is the first day of any month with a Friday the Thirteenth will be exactly 6 days before Friday. So, if Friday is the 13th day of the month, the first day of the month will be \\boxed{Saturday}."}
