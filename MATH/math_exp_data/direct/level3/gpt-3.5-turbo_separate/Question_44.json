{"question": "A solid sphere of ice with radius 4 is placed on a hollow cone (vertex pointed down) of radius 4 and height 5. When the ice melts, how much of the water will overflow the cone? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. (For this problem, we ignore the fact that the volume of water decreases when it melts.)", "answer": "The ice sphere has volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (4^3) = \\frac{4^4}{3}\\pi=\\frac{256}{3}\\pi\\] and the cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi(4^2)(5)=\\frac{80}{3}\\pi.\\]  When the ice melts, the amount of water that will overflow is \\[\\frac{256}{3}\\pi-\\frac{80}{3}\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac{176}{3}\\pi}.\\]", "agents_response": "Let's first calculate the volume of the ice sphere and the cone. \n\nVolume of the ice sphere with radius 4:\n$V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\dfrac{4}{3}\\pi(4^3) = \\dfrac{256}{3}\\pi$.\n\nVolume of the cone with radius 4 and height 5:\n$V_{\\text{cone}} = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\pi(4^2)(5) = \\dfrac{80}{3}\\pi$.\n\nWhen the sphere melts, it turns into water which will fill up the cone till it overflows. Therefore, the amount of water that will overflow the cone is:\n\n$V_{\\text{overflow}} = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cone}} = \\dfrac{256}{3}\\pi - \\dfrac{80}{3}\\pi = \\boxed{\\dfrac{176}{3}\\pi}$."}
