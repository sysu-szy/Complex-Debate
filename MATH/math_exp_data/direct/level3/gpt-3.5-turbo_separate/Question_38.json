{"question": "If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers such that $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, what is the value of $A+B+C$ given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1?", "answer": "Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the right hand side of the given equation by $\\sqrt{3}$, we have \\[\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C}=\\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{6}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] Thus, $A=3$, $B=3$, and $C=2$, so $A+B+C=3+3+2=\\boxed{8}$.", "agents_response": "Starting from the given equation, $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$ to get $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}\\sqrt{3}}{C\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{27}{6}$.\n\nThis simplifies further to $\\frac{A\\sqrt{3B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2}$. From this, we can see that $A \\sqrt{3B} = 9C$.\n\nSince $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, the only possibility is for $A = 9, B = 1, C = 2$. Therefore, $A+B+C = 9+1+2 = \\boxed{12}$."}
