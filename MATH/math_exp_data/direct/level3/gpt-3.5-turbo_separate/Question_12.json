{"question": "Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive?", "answer": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the total possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice, we multiply the number of outcomes of the first die (6) by the number of outcomes of the second die (6), which equals 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nNext, we list the possible sums that fall between 3 and 11, inclusive:\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\n\nWe find the number of favorable outcomes for each sum:\n- For a sum of 3: Only 1 outcome (1 and 2, 2 and 1)\n- For a sum of 4: 2 outcomes (1 and 3, 3 and 1, 2 and 2)\n- For a sum of 5: 3 outcomes (1 and 4, 4 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 2)\n- For a sum of 6: 4 outcomes (1 and 5, 5 and 1, 2 and 4, 4 and 2, 3 and 3)\n- For a sum of 7: 5 outcomes (1 and 6, 6 and 1, 2 and 5, 5 and 2, 3 and 4, 4 and 3)\n- For a sum of 8: 5 outcomes (2 and 6, 6 and 2, 3 and 5, 5 and 3, 4 and 4)\n- For a sum of 9: 4 outcomes (3 and 6, 6 and 3, 4 and 5, 5 and 4)\n- For a sum of 10: 3 outcomes (4 and 6, 6 and 4, 5 and 5)\n- For a sum of 11: 2 outcomes (5 and 6, 6 and 5)\n\nAdding up the number of favorable outcomes gives us 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 29.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive is 29/36.\n\n\\boxed{29/36}"}
