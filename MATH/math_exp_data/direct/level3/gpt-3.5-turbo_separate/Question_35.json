{"question": "The midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$. Find $(x,y)$.", "answer": "Applying the midpoint formula gives us $$\\left(\\frac{-9+x}{2},\\frac{1+y}{2}\\right)=(3,-5).$$Solving $\\frac{-9+x}{2} =3$ for $x$ and solving $\\frac{1+y}{2}=-5$ for $y$, we find the coordinates $(x,y)$ to be $\\boxed{(15,-11)}$.", "agents_response": "The midpoint between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:\n\nMidpoint $= \\left(\\dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$\n\nGiven that the midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$, we can set up the following equations:\n\n$\\dfrac{x + (-9)}{2} = 3$\n\n$\\dfrac{y + 1}{2} = -5$\n\nSolving the first equation:\n\n$\\dfrac{x - 9}{2} = 3$\n$x - 9 = 6$\n$x = 15$\n\nSolving the second equation:\n\n$\\dfrac{y + 1}{2} = -5$\n$y + 1 = -10$\n$y = -11$\n\nTherefore, the point $(x,y)$ is $(15,-11)$.\n\n\\boxed{(15,-11)}"}
