{"question": "Mrs. Read can knit one pair of children's mittens with a ball of yarn six inches in diameter. How many pairs of identical mittens can she knit with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter? Assume that the balls of yarn are rolled consistently.", "answer": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.", "agents_response": "The volume of a ball of yarn is directly proportional to its diameter cubed. \n\nSince the volume of a ball of yarn with diameter of 6 inches is $6^3 = 216$, and it yields one pair of mittens, the volume required for one pair of mittens is 216.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the new ball of yarn is 12 inches, the volume of the new ball will be $12^3 = 1728$.\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs of mittens that Mrs. Read can knit with the new ball of yarn is $\\frac{1728}{216}=\\boxed{8}$."}
