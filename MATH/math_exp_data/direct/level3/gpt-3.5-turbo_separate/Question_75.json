{"question": "For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job?", "answer": "We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nN+x &= 97\\\\\nN+5x &= 265\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \\begin{align*}\n4x &= 265-97=168\\\\\nx &= 42.\n\\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \\$ 55+2\\cdot \\$ 42 = \\boxed{\\$ 139}$.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the cost of coming out to the house as $N$ dollars and the cost per hour of work as $x$ dollars.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following two equations:\n$N + 1x = 97$\n$N + 5x = 265$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n$4x = 168$\n\nSolving for $x$, we find:\n$x = 42$\n\nNow, we can substitute $x = 42$ back into the first equation to find $N$:\n$N + 42 = 97$\n$N = 55$\n\nFor a two-hour repair job, the total charge would be:\n$N + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139$\n\nTherefore, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $\\boxed{139}$."}
