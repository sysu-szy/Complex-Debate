{"question": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?", "answer": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$.", "agents_response": "To find the $y$-intercept of a line, we need to find the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis, which occurs when $x = 0$. \n\nWe are given the point $(2,-3)$, so the equation of the line can be written as $y = mx + b$, where $m = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the slope and $(2,-3)$ satisfies the equation. Substituting the values of $(2,-3)$ into the equation, we get:\n$$-3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 + b$$\n$$-3 = 1 + b$$\n$$b = -4$$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 4$. To find the $y$-intercept, we set $x = 0$ in the equation:\n$$y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 - 4$$\n$$y = -4$$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{-4}$."}
