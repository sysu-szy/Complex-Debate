{"question": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $g(x) = [f(x)]^2.$  Find the range of the function $g(x).$", "answer": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $y^2$ can take on any value from 0 to 25, inclusive.  (If we take any value from $-3$ to 0 and square it, we get a value from 0 to 9.  And if we take any value from 0 to 5 and square it, we get a value from 0 to 25.)  Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[0,25]}.$", "agents_response": "Since the range of $f(x)$ is $[-3,5]$, the possible values of $f(x)$ are any real numbers between $-3$ and $5$, inclusive. \n\nWhen we square all the values in the range of $f(x)$ to get $g(x)=[f(x)]^2$, we get all nonnegative values. \n\nTherefore, the range of the function $g(x)$ is $[0, 25].$\n\n\\boxed{[0,25]}"}
