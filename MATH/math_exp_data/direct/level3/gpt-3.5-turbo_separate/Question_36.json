{"question": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line whose equation is $\\frac{x}4-\\frac{y}5=1$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "In slope-intercept form, the given equation becomes $y=\\frac{5}{4}x-5$.  The slope of this line is $\\frac{5}{4}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to this one is the negative of the reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{4}$, or $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}.$", "agents_response": "First, we need to rewrite the equation $\\frac{x}{4}-\\frac{y}{5}=1$ in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope.\n\nStart by isolating $y$:\n$$y=-\\frac{5}{4}x+5$$\n\nNow, the slope of the line is $m=-\\frac{5}{4}$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this is the negative reciprocal of $m$:\n$$\\text{Slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is } \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."}
