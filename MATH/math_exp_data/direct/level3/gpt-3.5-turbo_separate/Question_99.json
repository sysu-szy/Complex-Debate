{"question": "How many of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4 and 5?", "answer": "The least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is $3\\cdot4\\cdot5=60$, so we must find how many multiples of 60 are less than 500.  These multiples of 60 are $1\\cdot 60, 2\\cdot 60, \\ldots 8\\cdot 60$.  Thus, $\\boxed{8}$ of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5.", "agents_response": "To find the number of positive integers that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers. The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. \n\nSince 500 is divisible by 60, we need to divide 500 by 60 to find the number of positive integers that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5 within the first 500 positive integers.\n\n500 \u00f7 60 = 8 remainder 20\n\nSo, there are 8 positive integers (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480) that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5 within the first 500 positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{8}."}
