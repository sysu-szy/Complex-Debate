{"question": "How many terms of the sequence $\\sqrt{1},\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{4},\\ldots$ are less than or equal to $20$?", "answer": "$20^2 = 400$, so each of the square roots up through $\\sqrt{400}$ is less than or equal to $20$. Thus, because the sequence starts at $1$, there are $\\boxed{400}$ such terms.", "agents_response": "The $n$th term of the sequence is $\\sqrt{n}$. We want to find the largest integer $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n} \\leq 20$. \nBy squaring both sides, we get $n \\leq 400$. \nThe largest integer less than or equal to $400$ is $n = 400$. \nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{400}$."}
