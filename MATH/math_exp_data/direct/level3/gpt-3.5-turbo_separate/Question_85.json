{"question": "What is the greatest integer that satisfies $6 - x > -9$ ?", "answer": "Adding $x+9$ to both sides gives $$6-x+x+9 > -9+x+9,$$ then simplifying gives $$15 > x.$$ The greatest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{14}$.", "agents_response": "$6 - x > -9$\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n$-x > -15$\n\nMultiply by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:\n\n$x < 15$\n\nThe greatest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{14}$."}
