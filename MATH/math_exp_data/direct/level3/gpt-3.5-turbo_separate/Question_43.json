{"question": "Alistair Inc. shipped 32 packs of batteries to a retail store. Regular packs contain four batteries each, and super packs contain six batteries. A total of 166 batteries were shipped. How many regular packs were sent?", "answer": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$. Thus, $\\boxed{13}$ regular packs were sent.", "agents_response": "Let x be the number of regular packs and y be the number of super packs.\n\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the information given:\nx + y = 32\n4x + 6y = 166\n\nSolving the first equation for y:\ny = 32 - x\n\nSubstitute the value of y into the second equation:\n4x + 6(32 - x) = 166\n4x + 192 - 6x = 166\n-2x = -26\nx = 13\n\nTherefore, 13 regular packs were sent.\n\\boxed{13}"}
