{"question": "Simplify $\\sqrt{64^3}$.", "answer": "\\[\\sqrt{64^3}=\\sqrt{(2^6)^3}=\\sqrt{2^{18}}=2^9=\\boxed{512}.\\]", "agents_response": "To simplify $\\sqrt{64^3}$, we can first rewrite it as $(64^3)^{1/2}$. Using the property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we can rewrite this as $64^{3/2}$. \n\nNext, we find that $\\sqrt{64} = 8$, so $64^{1/2} = 8$. Since $(64^{1/2})^3 = 8^3 = 512$, our final answer is $\\boxed{512}$."}
