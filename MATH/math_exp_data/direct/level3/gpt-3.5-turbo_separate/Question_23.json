{"question": "How many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?", "answer": "In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": "To find the numbers that have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4, we need to consider that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. \n\nSince we are looking for numbers with a 2 in the units place that are divisible by 4, we consider the numbers 02, 12, 22, 32, ...., 192. Out of these, only 12, 32, 52, 72, 92 are divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."}
