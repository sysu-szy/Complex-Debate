{"question": "Find the positive difference between the solutions to the equation $6t^2 + 30 = 41t$.", "answer": "Rearranging the equation gives $6t^2 -41t + 30 = 0$.  Factoring gives $(t-6)(6t-5)= 0$, so the solutions to the equation are $t=6$ and $t=\\frac{5}{6}$.  The positive difference between these solutions is $6 - \\frac56 = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{6}}.$", "agents_response": "To find the solutions to the equation $6t^2 + 30 = 41t$, we first want to set the equation equal to zero by subtracting $41t$ from both sides:\n\n$6t^2 - 41t + 30 = 0$\n\nNext, we will factor the quadratic:\n\n$(3t - 10)(2t - 3) = 0$\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives us the solutions $t = \\frac{10}{3}, t = \\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nThe positive difference between these two solutions is $\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{4.5}{3} = \\frac{5.5}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{6}}$."}
