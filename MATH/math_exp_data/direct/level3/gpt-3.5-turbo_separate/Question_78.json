{"question": "A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?", "answer": "Let the other endpoint have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+6)/2=1$ and $(y+8)/2=1$, or $x=-4$ and $y=-6$. The sum of the coordinates is thus $-4+(-6)=\\boxed{-10}$.", "agents_response": "The midpoint of a line segment is the average of the coordinates of the endpoints. \n\nLet the other endpoint be $(x,y)$. \nThen, using the midpoint formula: \n$$\\left(\\frac{6+x}{2}, \\frac{8+y}{2}\\right) = (1,1)$$\nThis gives us the system of equations: \n$$\\frac{6+x}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{8+y}{2} = 1$$\nSolving these equations, we find: \n$$x = -4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -6$$\n\nSum of the coordinates of the other endpoint: \n$$x + y = -4 + (-6) = \\boxed{-10}$$"}
