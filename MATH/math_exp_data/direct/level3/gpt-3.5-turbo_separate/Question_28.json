{"question": "A cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?", "answer": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$.", "agents_response": "The label covers the lateral surface area of the can. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by $2\\pi rh$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\n\nGiven that the label has an area of $60\\pi$ square inches, we can now set up our equation:\n$2\\pi rh = 60\\pi$\n\nSince the height of the cylinder is given as 6 inches, we can substitute that into our equation:\n$2\\pi r(6) = 60\\pi$\n$12\\pi r = 60\\pi$\n$r = \\frac{60\\pi}{12\\pi} = 5$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the can is $\\boxed{5}$ inches."}
