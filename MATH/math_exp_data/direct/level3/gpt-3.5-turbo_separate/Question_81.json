{"question": "How many distinct positive integers can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\\}$?", "answer": "Since all of the integers are odd, the differences between any pair of them is always even. So, $13 - 1 = 12$ is the largest even integer that could be one of the differences. The smallest positive (even) integer that can be a difference is 2. So, the integers include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ integers.", "agents_response": "To find the distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}, we can first find all the possible differences between the numbers in the set.\n\nThe possible differences are:\n2 (3 - 1)\n4 (5 - 1, 9 - 5)\n6 (7 - 1, 13 - 7)\n8 (9 - 1, 11 - 3)\n10 (13 - 3, 11 - 1)\n12 (13 - 1)\n\nThis gives us the distinct positive integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, so there are \\boxed{6} distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the given set."}
