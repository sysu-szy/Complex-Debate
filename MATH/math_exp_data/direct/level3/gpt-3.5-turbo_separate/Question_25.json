{"question": "A two-digit integer is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$. What is the greatest possible value of $n$?", "answer": "We are looking for the greatest possible value of the digit $n$, so let's see if $n=9$ is a possibility. 99 is divisible by 9, so the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.", "agents_response": "For an integer to be divisible by $n$, the last digit must be a multiple of $n$. Since the last digit is $n$, the greatest possible value for $n$ is $5$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$."}
