{"question": "Alice is given the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9.$ She must choose a pair of these digits, with the digits being different, to form a two-digit number. How many of the numbers she can construct will be divisible by $3$?", "answer": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers.", "agents_response": "To create a number divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $3$. Out of the given numbers, $2+7=9$, $2+5=7$, $2+9=11$, $3+5=8$, $3+7=10$, $3+9=12$, $5+7=12$, $5+9=14$, and $7+9=16$. \n\nTherefore, Alice can create $\\boxed{3}$ numbers that are divisible by $3."}
