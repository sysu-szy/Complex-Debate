{"question": "Define a sequence recursively by $F_{0}=0,~F_{1}=1,$ and $F_{n}$ be the remainder when $F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ is divided by $3,$ for all $n\\geq 2.$ Thus the sequence starts $0,1,1,2,0,2,\\ldots$ What is $F_{2017}+F_{2018}+F_{2019}+F_{2020}+F_{2021}+F_{2022}+F_{2023}+F_{2024}?$", "answer": "The first few terms are as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\nF_0 &= 0, \\\\\nF_1 &= 1, \\\\\nF_2 &= 1, \\\\\nF_3 &= 2, \\\\\nF_4 &= 0, \\\\\nF_5 &= 2, \\\\\nF_6 &= 2, \\\\\nF_7 &= 1, \\\\\nF_8 &= 0, \\\\\nF_9 &= 1.\n\\end{align*}Since $F_8 = F_0$ and $F_9 = F_1,$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic, with period 8.\n\nThen the sum of the eight consecutive terms is simply the sum of the eight terms in the period, which is\n\\[0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{9}.\\]", "agents_response": "Notice that the remainder when $F_n$ is divided by $3$ repeats with a period of $8,$ which is evident when examining the sequence $0,1,1,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,1,2,\\ldots.$ \n\nWe can find that $F_{2017}, F_{2021}$ are both $0$ and $F_{2018}, F_{2022}$ are both $1.$ The remaining terms can be found as $F_{2019}=1, F_{2020}=2, F_{2023}=2, F_{2024}=1.$\n\nAdding these up, we get $0+1+1+2+0+2+2+1 = \\boxed{9}.$"}
