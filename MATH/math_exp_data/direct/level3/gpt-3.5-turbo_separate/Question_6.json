{"question": "Brass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?", "answer": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc.", "agents_response": "Let the total weight of the brass trumpet be $x$ ounces. Since the trumpet contains $80 \\%$ copper, the weight of copper in the trumpet is $0.8x$ ounces. We know that this weight is equal to 48 ounces, so we have:\n\n$0.8x = 48$ \n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{48}{0.8} = 60$ ounces\n\nTherefore, the weight of zinc in the trumpet is $20 \\%$ of 60 ounces, which is:\n\n$0.2 \\times 60 = 12$ \n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc in the trumpet."}
