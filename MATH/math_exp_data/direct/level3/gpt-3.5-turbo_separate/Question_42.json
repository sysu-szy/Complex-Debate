{"question": "What is the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have?", "answer": "An integer $n$ in the form $p^e$, for some prime $p$ and positive integer $e$, has $(e+1)$ positive factors. To maximize $e$, let $p=2$, the smallest prime. Since $n$ is less than 20, $e$ is at most 4, which means $n$ can have 5 factors. If $n$ is in the form $p_1^{e_1}\\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then let $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$ to find the maximum possible $e_1$ and $e_2$. Both cannot be 2 (else $n=36$), so $e_1, e_2=1, 2$ give the most factors: $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors. Finally, $n$ cannot be divisible by any other prime since $2\\cdot3\\cdot5=30>20$. Thus, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6 factors. Of course, we could have solved this problem by finding the number of factors of each positive integer less than 20, but in general our approach is more efficient.", "agents_response": "To determine the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have, we need to find the integer with the most number of factors. This is achieved by finding the number with the most prime factors. \n\nThe number 12 has the most prime factors among positive integers less than 20, with prime factors 2, 2, and 3. The number of factors of 12 is found by taking one more than the power of each prime factor and multiplying them together. So, the number of factors of 12 is (2+1)(1+1) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is \\boxed{6}."}
