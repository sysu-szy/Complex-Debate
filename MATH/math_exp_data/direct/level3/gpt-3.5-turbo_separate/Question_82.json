{"question": "Find a nonzero solution to the equation $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$.", "answer": "0 is the only number whose square root is 0, so we must have $4c-5c^2 = 0$.  Factoring gives $c(4-5c)=0$, so $c=0$ or $4-5c=0$.  Solving the latter equation gives $c=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$ as the only nonzero solution.", "agents_response": "To find a nonzero solution to the equation $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$, we need to first isolate the square root term.\n\n$\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n$4c-5c^2 = 0$\n\nRearrange the terms:\n\n$5c^2 - 4c = 0$\n\nFactor out a common factor of $c$:\n\n$c(5c - 4) = 0$\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\n$c = 0$ or $5c - 4 = 0$\n\nSolve for $c$ in the second equation:\n\n$5c - 4 = 0$\n\n$5c = 4$\n\n$c = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the nonzero solution to the equation is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."}
