{"question": "Triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and the measure of angle $R$ is $40^\\circ$. The possible measures of angle $P$ are $x,y,z$. What is the value of the sum $x + y + z$?", "answer": "The remaining two angles are either 40 degrees and $180-40-40=100$ degrees, or they are both $(180-40)/2=70$ degrees.  The sum of the distinct possible values for angle $P$ is $40+100+70=\\boxed{210}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "Since triangle $PQR$ is isosceles, angles $P$ and $Q$ are congruent. \nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write $40^\\circ + P + P = 180^\\circ$.\nSolving for $P$, we get $2P = 140^\\circ$ which implies $P = 70^\\circ$.\nTherefore, the possible measures of angle $P$ are $70^\\circ, 70^\\circ, 70^\\circ$.\nThe sum $x + y + z = 70 + 70 + 70 = 210$\nSo, $\\boxed{210}$ is the answer."}
