{"question": "The number of cubic inches in the volume of a 6-inch high cylindrical can equals the number of square inches in the area of the label that covers the lateral surface of the can. In inches, what is the radius of the can?", "answer": "Let $r$ be the number of inches in the radius of the can.  The volume of the can is $\\pi r^2(\\text{height})=6\\pi r^2$ cubic inches.  The lateral surface area is $2\\pi r (\\text{height})=12\\pi r$ square inches.  Setting $6\\pi r^2$ equal to $12\\pi r$, we find  \\begin{align*}\n6\\pi r^2-12\\pi r&=0 \\implies \\\\\n6\\pi r( r-2 )&=0 \\implies \\\\\nr=0 \\quad &\\text{or}\\quad r=2.\n\\end{align*} Taking the positive solution $r=2$, we find that the radius of the can is $\\boxed{2}$ inches.", "agents_response": "Let the radius of the cylindrical can be represented as r.\n\nThe volume of the can is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where h is the height of the can.\nGiven that the can is 6 inches high, the volume is V = \u03c0r^2 * 6 = 6\u03c0r^2 cubic inches.\n\nThe lateral surface area of the can is given by the formula A = 2\u03c0rh.\nGiven that the height of the can is 6 inches, the lateral surface area is A = 2\u03c0r * 6 = 12\u03c0r square inches.\n\nAccording to the problem, the volume equals the area of the label, so:\n6\u03c0r^2 = 12\u03c0r\n\nDivide both sides by 6\u03c0:\nr = 2\n\n\\boxed{r=2}"}
