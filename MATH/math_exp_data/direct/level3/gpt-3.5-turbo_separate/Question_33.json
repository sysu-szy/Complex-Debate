{"question": "Find the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250. Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "answer": "Since $1,\\,2,\\,3,\\ldots,250$ is an arithmetic sequence, the mean of all of the terms is equal to the mean of the first and last terms. (To see this, remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.)  So the mean is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+250) = \\boxed{125.5}$.", "agents_response": "To find the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250, we need to add up all the numbers from 1 to 250 and then divide by the total number of integers from 1 to 250.\n\nThe sum of the integers from 1 to 250 is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nS = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nwhere n is the number of terms, the first term in this case is 1, and the last term is 250.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integers from 1 to 250 is:\nS = 250/2 * (1 + 250) = 125 * 251 = 31375\n\nThe total number of terms from 1 to 250 is 250.\n\nTherefore, the mean is calculated by:\nMean = Sum of all numbers / Total number of numbers = 31375 / 250 = 125.5\n\nThus, the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250 is \\boxed{125.5}."}
