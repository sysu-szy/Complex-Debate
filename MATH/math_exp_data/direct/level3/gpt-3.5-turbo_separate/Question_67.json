{"question": "Suppose $P$ is the point $(5,3)$ and $Q$ is the point $(-3,6)$. Find point $T$ such that $Q$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PT}$.", "answer": "Let the coordinates of $T$ be $(x,y)$. Then, the midpoint of $\\overline{PT}$ is $\\left(\\frac{x+5}{2}, \\frac{y+3}{2}\\right)$.  Since we know the coordinates of this point are those of point $Q$, $(-3,6)$, we have $(x+5)/2 = -3$ and $(y+3)/2 = 6$.  Solving these equations gives $x = -11$ and $y = 9$, so point $T$ is at $\\boxed{(-11,9)}$.", "agents_response": "Let the coordinates of point $T$ be $(x,y)$. Since point $Q$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PT}$, we can use the midpoint formula to find $T$.\nThe midpoint formula is:\nMidpoint = $\\left(\\frac{{x_1 + x_2}}{2}, \\frac{{y_1 + y_2}}{2}\\right)$\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\n$(-3,6) = \\left(\\frac{{5+x}}{2}, \\frac{{3+y}}{2}\\right)$\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$ gives:\n$-3 = \\frac{5+x}{2} \\implies x = -11$\n$6 = \\frac{3+y}{2} \\implies y = 9$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $T$ are $(-11,9)$.\n\n\\boxed{(-11,9)}"}
