{"question": "I have a bag with yellow and blue marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. If I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 7:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I added more?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$. Additionally, after we add blue marbles and remove yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be x+5 and y-3 respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $7:3$, so $\\dfrac{x+5}{y-3}=\\dfrac{7}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $3x=4y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x+5)=7(y-3)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=12$, $x=16$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before more were added, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{16}$.", "agents_response": "Let B = number of blue marbles and Y = number of yellow marbles. \n\nGiven:\nB/Y = 4/3\n(B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nFrom the first equation, we can represent B in terms of Y:\nB = (4/3)Y\n\nSubstitute B = (4/3)Y into the second equation:\n((4/3)Y + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n(4Y + 15)/(3Y - 9) = 7/3\n3(4Y + 15) = 7(3Y - 9)\n12Y + 45 = 21Y - 63\n9Y = 108\nY = 12\n\nSubstitute Y = 12 into B = (4/3)Y:\nB = (4/3)(12)\nB = 16\n\nTherefore, there were \\boxed{16} blue marbles in the bag before adding more."}
