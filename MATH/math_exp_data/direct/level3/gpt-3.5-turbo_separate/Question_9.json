{"question": "What is the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$?", "answer": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot7$ and $365=5\\cdot73$, $(28,365)=1$. Therefore, $28n$ is divisible by 365 if and only if $n$ is divisible by both 5 and 73. Thus, the least value of $n$ is $5\\cdot73=\\boxed{365}$.", "agents_response": "We are looking for the least positive integer $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$. This means that we are looking for the least common multiple of $28$ and $365$.\n\nWe can find the least common multiple by calculating the product of the two numbers and dividing it by their greatest common divisor. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the greatest common divisor of $28$ and $365$ is $1$. Therefore, the least common multiple of $28$ and $365$ is $28 \\times 365 = 10220$.\n\nThe least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$ is $\\frac{10220}{28} = \\boxed{365}$."}
