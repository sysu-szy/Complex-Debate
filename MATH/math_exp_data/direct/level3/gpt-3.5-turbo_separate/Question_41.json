{"question": "In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.", "answer": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $$\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3} = \\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)}.$$In this representation we can immediately read that there is a hole at $x=-3$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors we have\n$$\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}.$$We can write $\\frac{x}{x+1}$ as $1 - \\frac{1}{x+1}$ which shows that as $x$ becomes very large, the graph tends towards $1$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+3+0 = \\boxed{6}.$", "agents_response": "To find the number of holes in the graph, we first factor the numerator and denominator of the given rational function: $\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+1)(x+3)}$. We see that there is a hole at $x=-3$.\n\nNext, to find the number of vertical asymptotes, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$: $(x+1)(x+3)=0 \\Rightarrow x=-1, -3$. So, there are two vertical asymptotes.\n\nTo find the number of horizontal asymptotes, we compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$.\n\nThere are no oblique asymptotes in the graph of this rational function.\n\nTherefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1 + 2(2) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 1 + 4 + 3 = \\boxed{8}$."}
