{"question": "How many of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5?$", "answer": "We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number.", "agents_response": "To find how many positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by all three. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5.\nThe prime factorization of 3 is $3$, of 4 is $2^2$, and of 5 is $5$. \nThe LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5 = 60$.\nThe positive integers that are divisible by 60 are the numbers $60, 120, 180, ..., 600$. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5 from the first 100 positive integers."}
