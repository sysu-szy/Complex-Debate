{"question": "How many positive integers $x$ satisfy $x-4<3$?", "answer": "Add 4 to both sides of the inequality to find $x<7$.  This inequality is satisfied by the $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers between 1 and 6 inclusive.", "agents_response": "We add 4 to both sides of the inequality to isolate $x$:\n\n$x - 4 + 4 < 3 + 4$\n\n$x < 7$\n\nTherefore, $x$ can be any positive integer less than 7, which are the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThus, $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers satisfy the inequality $x - 4 < 3$."}
