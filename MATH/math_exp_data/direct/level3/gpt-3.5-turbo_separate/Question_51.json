{"question": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?", "answer": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$.", "agents_response": "To find the $y$-intercept, we first need to find the equation of the line in the point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the given point and $m$ is the slope. \n\nSubstitute $(2,-3)$ for $(x_1, y_1)$ and $\\frac12$ for the slope $m$:\n$y - (-3) = \\frac12(x - 2)$\n$y + 3 = \\frac12x - 1$\n$y = \\frac12x - 4$\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, let $x = 0$ and solve for $y$:\n$y = \\frac12(0) - 4$\n$y = -4$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{-4}$."}
