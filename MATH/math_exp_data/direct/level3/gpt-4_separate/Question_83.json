{"question": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?", "answer": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$.", "agents_response": "Using the point-slope formula $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the point the line passes through and $m$ is the slope, we have $y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 2)$. Simplifying, this gives $y + 3 = \\frac{1}{2}x - 1$ or $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 4$.\n\nThe y-intercept of a line represented by the equation $y = mx + b$ is the point $(0, b)$.  Therefore, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of this line is $-4$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{-4}$."}
