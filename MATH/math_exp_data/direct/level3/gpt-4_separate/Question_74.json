{"question": "In $\\triangle PQR$, we have $PQ = QR = 34$ and $PR = 32$.  Find the length of median $\\overline{QM}$.", "answer": "Because $\\triangle PQR$ is isosceles with $PQ=QR$, median $\\overline{QM}$ is also an altitude:\n\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\npair P,Q,R,M,NN;\nP = (0,0);\nQ = (0.5,0.9);\nR = (1,0);\nNN = (0.5,0);\nM = (Q+R)/2;\ndraw(rightanglemark(Q,NN,P,2.5));\ndraw(P--Q--R--P);\ndraw(Q--NN);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,SW);\nlabel(\"$R$\",R,SE);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",Q,N);\nlabel(\"$M$\",NN,S);\n[/asy]\n\nWe have $MP = PR/2 = 16$, so right triangle $PQM$ gives us  \\begin{align*}\nQM &= \\sqrt{PQ^2 - PM^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{34^2 - 16^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(34-16)(34+16)}\\\\\n& = \\boxed{30}.\n\\end{align*}  (We might also have recognized that $PM/PQ = 8/17$, so $QM/PQ = 15/17$.)", "agents_response": "In a triangle, a median is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, $QM$ is a median of $\\triangle PQR$.\n\nBecause $PQ = QR$, $\\triangle PQR$ is an isosceles triangle and therefore $M$ is also the midpoint of $PR$. \n\nThus we can use the formula for the length of the median in an isosceles triangle, \n\n$m = \\sqrt{2a^2 - \\frac{1}{2}b^2}$, \n\nwhere $a$ is the length of the equal sides and $b$ is the length of the base. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we have,\n\n$m = \\sqrt{ 2(34^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(32^2)}$\n  \n$m = \\sqrt{2*1156 - \\frac{1}{2}*1024}$\n  \n$m = \\sqrt{2312 - 512}$.\n  \n$m = \\sqrt{1800}$\n\n$m = 30\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the length of median $\\overline{QM}$ is $\\boxed{30\\sqrt{2}}$."}
