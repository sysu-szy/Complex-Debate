{"question": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they are either both hearts or both diamonds?", "answer": "There are $\\binom{52}{2}=\\frac{52\\cdot 51}{2}=26\\cdot 51$ ways to choose two cards from a 52-card deck. There are $\\binom{13}{2}=\\frac{13\\cdot 12}{2}$ ways to choose two cards which are both hearts, and the same number of ways to choose two cards which are both diamonds. Therefore, the probability of choosing two cards which are both hearts or both diamonds is $\\frac{13 \\cdot 12}{26 \\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{17}}$.", "agents_response": "There are 13 hearts and 13 diamonds in a deck, making a total of 26 favorable cards. \n\nThe probability that the first card drawn is either a heart or a diamond is 26/52 = 1/2. \n\nAfter one card has been drawn, there are now 51 cards left. Now, the probability that next card drawn is also a heart or diamond is 25/51.\n\nSince we want the probability that both cards drawn are EITHER hearts or diamonds, we multiply the probability of each event. \n\nSo, the probability that both cards are either hearts or diamonds is (1/2) * (25/51) = 25/102.\n\nSo, the simplified answer is \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}."}
