{"question": "A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?", "answer": "Let the other endpoint have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+6)/2=1$ and $(y+8)/2=1$, or $x=-4$ and $y=-6$. The sum of the coordinates is thus $-4+(-6)=\\boxed{-10}$.", "agents_response": "The formula for the midpoint of a line segment is the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints. Thus, if we let $(x, y)$ be the other endpoint, we get the system of equations $(x + 6)/2 = 1$ and $(y + 8)/2 = 1$. Simplifying these equations gives $x = -4$ and $y = -6$. Thus, the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is $(-4) + (-6) = \\boxed{-10}$."}
