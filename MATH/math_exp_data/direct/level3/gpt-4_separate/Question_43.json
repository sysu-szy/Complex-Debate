{"question": "Alistair Inc. shipped 32 packs of batteries to a retail store. Regular packs contain four batteries each, and super packs contain six batteries. A total of 166 batteries were shipped. How many regular packs were sent?", "answer": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$. Thus, $\\boxed{13}$ regular packs were sent.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the regular packs as r and super packs as s. We know from the problem that:\n\nr + s = 32, (since 32 packs of batteries were shipped)\n4r + 6s = 166, (since it was said that there was a total of 166 batteries)\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for r (number of regular packs).\n\nLet's first multiply the first equation by 4:\n4r + 4s = 128\n\nThen subtract it from the second equation:\n4r + 6s - (4r + 4s) = 166 - 128\n2s = 38.\n\nTherefore the number of super packs is s = 38 / 2 = 19.\n\nSubstitute s = 19 into the first equation:\nr + 19 = 32,\nr = 32 - 19 = \\boxed{13}. \n\nHence, Alistair Inc. shipped 13 regular packs of batteries to the retail store."}
