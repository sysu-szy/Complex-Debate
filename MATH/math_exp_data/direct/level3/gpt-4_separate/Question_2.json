{"question": "Simplify $\\frac{\\sqrt{72}}{\\sqrt{10}}$. Your answer should have an integer denominator.", "answer": "$\\frac{\\sqrt{72}}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{72}\\cdot\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{10}\\cdot\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{720}}{10} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{5}}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{5}}$.", "agents_response": "We start by simplifying the square roots of 72 and 10 separately.\n\n$\\sqrt{72}$ simplifies to $6\\sqrt{2}$ because $72 = 36 * 2$, and the square root of $36$ is $6$.\n\n$\\sqrt{10}$ simplifies to $\\sqrt{10}$ because $10$ can't be simplified further as a perfect square.\n\nNow we have $\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{10}}$.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator (which means to get rid of the square root in the denominator), we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by $\\sqrt{10}$ to get $\\frac{6\\sqrt{20}}{10}$.\n\nThis further simplifies to $\\frac{6\\sqrt{4*5}}{10}$ and then to $\\frac{6*2\\sqrt{5}}{10}$, and finally to $\\frac{12\\sqrt{5}}{10}$.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by cancelling out the common factor of $2$, which gives us $\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{5}$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{\\sqrt{72}}{\\sqrt{10}}$ simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{5}}$."}
