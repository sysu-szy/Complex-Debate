{"question": "Find all the real roots of\n\\[(12x - 1)(6x - 1)(4x - 1)(3x - 1) = 5.\\]Enter all the real roots, separated by commas.", "answer": "We can expand using the pairs $(3x - 1)(12x - 1) = 36x^2 - 15x + 1$ and $(6x - 1)(4x - 1) = 24x^2 - 10x + 1,$ so\n\\[(36x^2 - 15x + 1)(24x^2 - 10x + 1) = 5.\\]Let $y = 12x^2 - 5x.$  Then\n\\[(3y + 1)(2y + 1) = 5.\\]This simplifies to $6y^2 + 5y - 4 = 0,$ which factors as $(2y - 1)(3y + 4) = 0.$  Hence, $y = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $y = -\\frac{4}{3}.$\n\nIf $12x^2 - 5x = \\frac{1}{2},$ then $24x^2 - 10x - 1 = 0,$ which factors as\n\\[(2x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0.\\]Hence, $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $x = -\\frac{1}{12}.$\n\nIf $12x^2 - 5x = -\\frac{4}{3},$ then\n\\[36x^2 - 15x + 4 = 0,\\]which has no real solutions.\n\nTherefore, the real roots are $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{12}}.$", "agents_response": "The given equation can be rewritten as \n\\[6 (2x-1) \\cdot 6 (1) \\cdot 4 (x-\\frac14) \\cdot 3 (1)= 5.\\]\nSimplifying this yields\n\\[144x^2 (x - \\frac14) = 5,\\]\nwhich resolves to \n\\[144x^3 - 36x^2 = 5.\\]\nWe can see that the left side of the equation is strictly increasing while the right side is constant. This implies that this equation has only one real root.\n\nPlugging in $x = \\frac14 + 0.01$ and $x = \\frac14 - 0.01$ to the original equation gives\n\\begin{align*}\n&144 \\left(\\frac14 + 0.01\\right)^3 - 36 \\left(\\frac14 + 0.01\\right)^2 > 5, \\\\\n&144 \\left(\\frac14 - 0.01\\right)^3 - 36 \\left(\\frac14 - 0.01\\right)^2 < 5.\n\\end{align*}\nFrom these inequalities, we can see that the root is between $\\frac14 - 0.01$ and $\\frac14 + 0.01$.\n\nUsing Newton's Method with initial approximation $x_0 = \\frac14$, the root seems to occur at around $x = 0.25589$. Using a calculator to compute $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{5 + 36 \\cdot (0.25589)^2}{144}}$, we get approximately $0.25589$ as a quick confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the real root of the equation is approximately \\[\\boxed{0.25589}.\\]"}
