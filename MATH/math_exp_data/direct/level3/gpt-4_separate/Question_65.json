{"question": "The sequence $(a_n)$ is defined by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 2,$ and\n\\[a_n^2 - a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1} = 1\\]for all $n \\ge 2.$  Find $a_{100}.$", "answer": "Isolating $a_{n + 1},$ we find\n\\[a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n^2 - 1}{a_{n - 1}}.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\na_3 &= \\frac{a_2^2 - 1}{a_1} = \\frac{2^2 - 1}{1} = 3, \\\\\na_4 &= \\frac{a_3^2 - 1}{a_2} = \\frac{3^2 - 1}{2} = 4, \\\\\na_5 &= \\frac{a_4^2 - 1}{a_3} = \\frac{4^2 - 1}{3} = 5,\n\\end{align*}and so on.\n\nBy induction, we can show that $a_n = n$ for all positive integers $n.$  In particular, $a_{100} = \\boxed{100}.$", "agents_response": "Let's look at the first few terms to find a pattern. Call this sequence A. Using the initial terms, we have:\nA[1] = 1\nA[2] = 2\nA[3] = 2^2 - 1^*1 = 3\nA[4] = 3^2 - 2*1 = 7\nA[5] = 7^2 - 3*2 = 24\nWe see that A[n] = A[n-1] + (n-1).\n\nSo, to calculate A[100], we need to calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to 99 (inclusive). This is equal to:\n0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 = 99*100/2 = 4950.\n\nAdditionally, we recall that the initial term, A[1], is 1, so we need to add this to the sum.\n\nTherefore, A[100] = 4950 + 1 = \\boxed{4951}."}
