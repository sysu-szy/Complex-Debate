{"question": "At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?", "answer": "We start with $ 2^{1+\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor}-N = 19$. After rearranging, we get\n\\[\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor = \\log_{2} \\left(\\frac{N+19}{2}\\right).\\]Since $ \\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor $ is a positive integer, $ \\frac{N+19}{2}$ must be in the form of $2^{m} $ for some positive integer $ m $. From this fact, we get $N=2^{m+1}-19$.\n\nIf we now check integer values of $N$ that satisfy this condition, starting from $N=19$, we quickly see that the first values that work for $N$ are $2^6 -19$ and $2^7 -19$, giving values of $5$ and $6$ for $m$, respectively. Adding up these two values for $N$, we get $45 + 109 = \\boxed{154}$.", "agents_response": "The number of elite players equals $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N=19$, which means $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor} = N+19$. Notice that $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ is always a power of two. Given $N+19$ is a power of two, and $N$ is positive, we know that $N$ is of the form $2^m - 19$ for some positive integer $m$. So we can iterate through small values of $m$ until we confirm that $2^m - 19 > 0$ for $m$ and provides a valid solution. The smallest nonnegative integer larger than or equal to $\\log_2{19}$ is $5$. Therefore, the two smallest values of $m$ are $5$ and $6$. Substituting, we find that the two smallest possible values of $N$ are $2^5 - 19 = 13, 2^6 - 19 = 45$. The sum of these two values is \\boxed{58}."}
