{"question": "Find a nonzero solution to the equation $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$.", "answer": "0 is the only number whose square root is 0, so we must have $4c-5c^2 = 0$.  Factoring gives $c(4-5c)=0$, so $c=0$ or $4-5c=0$.  Solving the latter equation gives $c=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$ as the only nonzero solution.", "agents_response": "First, square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root. This gives $4c - 5c^2 = 0$. Factor out $c$ from the equation to get $c(4 - 5c) = 0$. This gives us the solutions $c = 0$ or $c = \\frac{4}{5}$. Since we are looking for a nonzero solution, the solution is \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}."}
