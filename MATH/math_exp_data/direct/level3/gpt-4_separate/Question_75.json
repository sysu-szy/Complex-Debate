{"question": "For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job?", "answer": "We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nN+x &= 97\\\\\nN+5x &= 265\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \\begin{align*}\n4x &= 265-97=168\\\\\nx &= 42.\n\\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \\$ 55+2\\cdot \\$ 42 = \\boxed{\\$ 139}$.", "agents_response": "We are given two equations according to the charges:\nFor a one-hour repair job that is charged $97.\nSo, $N+1x = 97$.\nFor a five-hour repair job that is charged $265.\nSo, $N+5x= 265$.\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $N$ and $x$. From the first equation, \n$N = 97-x$.\nSubstitute this value in second equation, we get:\n$97-x+5x = 265 \\Rightarrow 4x = 168 \\Rightarrow x = 42$.\nSubstitute $x = 42$ in the first equation,\nWe get $N = 97-42 = 55$.\n\nSo, for a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench would charge: \n$N + 2x = 55 + 2*42 = \\boxed{139}$ dollars."}
