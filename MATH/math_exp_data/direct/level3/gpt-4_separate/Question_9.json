{"question": "What is the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$?", "answer": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot7$ and $365=5\\cdot73$, $(28,365)=1$. Therefore, $28n$ is divisible by 365 if and only if $n$ is divisible by both 5 and 73. Thus, the least value of $n$ is $5\\cdot73=\\boxed{365}$.", "agents_response": "To find an integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$, we need to find a multiple of $365$ that is also a multiple of $28$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $365$ is $5*73$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $28$ is $2^2*7$. \n\nAs there are no common factors between $365$ and $28$ besides $1$, the least positive integer value for $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$ is when $n=365$.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{365}."}
