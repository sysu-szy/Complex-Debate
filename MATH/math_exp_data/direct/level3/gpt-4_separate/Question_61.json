{"question": "In any month with a Friday the Thirteenth, what day of the week is the first day of the same month?", "answer": "If the 13th is a Friday, then the 14th is a Saturday, and the 15th is a Sunday.  Subtracting 14 days (which is two weeks), we find that the first of the month is also a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.", "agents_response": "Since Friday the Thirteenth happens, it means that the 13th day of the month is a Friday. In calendar mathematics, we subtract the number of days in a week (which is 7) from 13 until we get a number that is less than 7. In this case, if we subtract 7 from 13 two times, we get -1. The day of the week that is \"1 day before\" Friday is Thursday. Therefore, the first day of that month is a Thursday. \n\n\\boxed{Thursday}."}
