{"question": "Three squares each have sides of length 6 units and overlap each other as shown below. The points where the sides cross are midpoints.

The area of this larger square is 9^2 = 81 square units.\n\nEach of the smaller squares has an area of 6^2 = 36 square units. Since there are three of these, their total area is 3 * 36 = 108 square units.\n\nHowever, since the smaller squares overlap, some of their area is counted twice in the total. This overlapping area is equivalent to the area of one of the smaller squares, or 36 square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the gray figure is the total area of the larger square minus the overlapped area, or 81 - 36 = \\boxed{45} square units."}
