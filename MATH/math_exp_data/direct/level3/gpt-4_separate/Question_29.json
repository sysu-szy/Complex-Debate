{"question": "Each week, between 30 and 50 students show up for an archery class run by Betty and Wilma.  Usually the students break up into groups of equal size for target practice.  However, this week, Betty noticed that she could not break the students up into multiple groups of equal size.  Wilma noticed that if she and Betty both joined the students in practicing, they still could not break the archers up into groups of equal size.  How many students showed up to the archery class this week?", "answer": "Let $n$ be the number of students at class.  Betty noticed that $n$ has no divisors between 1 and itself, so $n$ is prime.  Wilma noticed that $n + 2$ is prime.  This means we are looking for the smaller of two primes that differ by 2 that are between 30 and 50.  The primes in that range are 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.  Since 41 and 43 differ by 2, $n = \\boxed{41}$.", "agents_response": "The number of students that showed up to the archery class this week is a number between 30 and 50 that is not divisible by any number besides 1 and itself. We can also add that adding 2 to that number (for Betty and Wilma) still results in a number that isn't divisible by any other number except 1 and itself. This means we are looking for a pair of consecutive prime numbers between 30 and 50. 37 and 39 are not both prime. 41 and 43 meet both conditions. So 41 is the number of students that attended the archery class this week. \nSo, \\boxed{41}."}
