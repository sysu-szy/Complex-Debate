{"question": "Compute $126_7 - 54_7.$ Express your answer in base $7.$", "answer": "We subtract the rightmost digits as usual. However, for the next digits, we need to borrow as shown: $$ \\begin{array}{cccccc} & & & \\cancelto{0}{1} & \\cancelto{9}{2} & 6_7\\\\ &- & & & 5 & 4_7\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & 4 & 2_7\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{42_7}.$", "agents_response": "Subtracting in base $7$ is similar to subtracting in base $10$, except we borrow or carry with $7$'s instead of $10$'s. \n\nFirst, look at the units digit. We can't directly subtract $4$ from $6,$ so we borrow from the tens digit. Instead of writing $12_7-5_7$ in the tens place, it would become $11_7-5_7,$ and the units would become $16_7-4_7.$ \n\nSo, $126_7 - 54_7$ turns into $116_7 - 54_7.$ \n\n$16_7 - 4_7 = 12_7$ and $11_7 - 5_7 = 6_7.$ \n\nThus, $126_7 - 54_7 = \\boxed{62_7}.$"}
