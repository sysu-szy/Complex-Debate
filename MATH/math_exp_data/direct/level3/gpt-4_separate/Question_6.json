{"question": "Brass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?", "answer": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc.", "agents_response": "The problem states that brass is made up of $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. This means that for every ounce of brass, there is $0.8$ ounces of copper and $0.2$ ounces of zinc. \n\nWe are told that Henri's trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper and we want to find out how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet. Since this copper makes up $80\\%$ of the total mass of the trumpet, we can find out the total mass of the trumpet by dividing the amount of copper by $0.8$. This will give us the total mass of the trumpet in ounces:\n\n$\\frac{48 \\text{ ounces}}{0.8} = 60 \\text{ ounces}$.\n\nSince $20\\%$ of the total mass of the trumpet is zinc, the amount of zinc in the trumpet is $60 * 0.2 = 12$ ounces of zinc.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{12}."}
