{"question": "Suppose $P$ is the point $(5,3)$ and $Q$ is the point $(-3,6)$. Find point $T$ such that $Q$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PT}$.", "answer": "Let the coordinates of $T$ be $(x,y)$. Then, the midpoint of $\\overline{PT}$ is $\\left(\\frac{x+5}{2}, \\frac{y+3}{2}\\right)$.  Since we know the coordinates of this point are those of point $Q$, $(-3,6)$, we have $(x+5)/2 = -3$ and $(y+3)/2 = 6$.  Solving these equations gives $x = -11$ and $y = 9$, so point $T$ is at $\\boxed{(-11,9)}$.", "agents_response": "To find point $T$, we first need to understand what a midpoint is. A midpoint, in this case $Q$, is the point exactly halfway between two other points, $P$ and $T$. So, we could say that the coordinates of $Q$ is the average of the coordinates of $P$ and $T$. \n\nSo we have equations:\n$x$ coordinate: $\\frac{5 + x_T}{2} = -3$\n$y$ coordinate: $\\frac{3 + y_T}{2} = 6$\n\nSolving these equations for $x_T$ and $y_T$ (the coordinates of point $T$), we get:\n\n$x_T = 2(-3) - 5 = -6 -5 = -11$\n$y_T = 2(6) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9$\n\nTherefore, point $T$ is $(-11, 9)$. We can check this by calculating the midpoint of points $P$ and $T$ and confirm whether we get point $Q$ or not. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{(-11, 9)}."}
