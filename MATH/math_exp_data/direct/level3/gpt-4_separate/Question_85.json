{"question": "What is the greatest integer that satisfies $6 - x > -9$ ?", "answer": "Adding $x+9$ to both sides gives $$6-x+x+9 > -9+x+9,$$ then simplifying gives $$15 > x.$$ The greatest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{14}$.", "agents_response": "To find the greatest integer that satisfies the inequality $6 - x > -9$, first solve for $x$:\n\n$6 - x > -9$\n\nAdd $x$ to both sides:\n\n$6 > x - 9$\n\nAdd $9$ to both sides:\n\n$6 + 9 > x$\n\n$15 > x$\n\nThe inequality is saying that $x$ is less than $15$. The greatest integer that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{14}$."}
