{"question": "A solid sphere of ice with radius 4 is placed on a hollow cone (vertex pointed down) of radius 4 and height 5. When the ice melts, how much of the water will overflow the cone? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. (For this problem, we ignore the fact that the volume of water decreases when it melts.)", "answer": "The ice sphere has volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (4^3) = \\frac{4^4}{3}\\pi=\\frac{256}{3}\\pi\\] and the cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi(4^2)(5)=\\frac{80}{3}\\pi.\\]  When the ice melts, the amount of water that will overflow is \\[\\frac{256}{3}\\pi-\\frac{80}{3}\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac{176}{3}\\pi}.\\]", "agents_response": "The volume of the water in the cone can be given by the formula V=1/3*pi*r^2*h. Here, r=4 and h=5. \nSo, the volume of the water in the cone is V=1/3*pi*4^2*5 =80/3*pi.\n\nThe volume of the ice sphere is given by the formula V=4/3*pi*r^3. Here, r=4. \nSo, the volume of the ice sphere is V=4/3*pi*4^3=256/3*pi.\n\nThe volume of the ice sphere is larger than the volume of the water in the cone, hence some of the ice will overflow when it melts. The volume of the overflow can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the water in the cone from the volume of the ice sphere.\nSo, the volume of overflow = volume of ice sphere - volume of water in cone\n= 256/3*pi - 80/3*pi\n= (256-80)/3*pi = 176/3*pi.\n\nHence, \\boxed{\\frac{176}{3}\\pi} of the water will overflow the cone when the ice melts."}
