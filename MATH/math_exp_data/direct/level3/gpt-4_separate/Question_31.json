{"question": "The planes defined by\n\\begin{align*}\n-x + cy + bz &= 0, \\\\\ncx - y + az &= 0, \\\\\nbx + ay - z &= 0\n\\end{align*}all contain the same line.  Find all possible values of\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc.\\]Enter all the possible values, separated by commas.", "answer": "The normal vectors of the planes are $\\mathbf{n}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ c \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix},$ $\\mathbf{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ -1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix},$ and $\\mathbf{n}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ a \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, the direction vector of the common line is proportional to\n\\[\\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} ac + b \\\\ a + bc \\\\ 1 - c^2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]It is also proportional to\n\\[\\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{n}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -ab - c \\\\ b^2 - 1 \\\\ -a - bc \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Since these vectors are proportional,\n\\[(ac + b)(b^2 - 1) = (a + bc)(-ab - c).\\]Then $(ac + b)(b^2 - 1) - (a + bc)(-ab - c) = 0,$ which simplifies to\n\\[a^2 b + 2ab^2 c + b^3 + bc^2 - b = 0.\\]This factors as $b(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc - 1) = 0.$\n\nSimilarly,\n\\[(ac + b)(-a - bc) = (1 - c^2)(-ab - c).\\]This becomes $c(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc - 1) = 0.$\n\nIf both $b = 0$ and $c = 0,$ then the equations of the planes become\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 0, \\\\\n-y + az &= 0, \\\\\nay - z &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Then $y = az.$  Substituting into the third equation, we get $a^2 z - z = 0,$ so $(a^2 - 1) z = 0.$  If $a^2 \\neq 1,$ then we must have $z = 0,$ which leads to $y = 0,$ so the three planes only have the point $(0,0,0)$ in common.  Hence, $a^2 = 1.$  Then the equations of the planes become $x = 0,$ $y = z,$ and $y = z,$ and their intersection is a line.  Also,\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc = 1.\\]Otherwise, at least one of $b$ and $c$ is nonzero, so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc - 1 = 0.$  Hence,\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc = 1.\\]We conclude that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc$ is always equal to $\\boxed{1}.$", "agents_response": "From the problem condition the sum of three equations should equal to zero which will be\n\\[x(a-b+c) + y(b-c+a) + z(c-a+b) = 0.\\]\nThus, $(a-b+c) = (b-c+a) = (c-a+b) = 0.$ It follows that $a = b = c,$ so\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2abc = 3a^2 + 2a^3 = a^2(3 + 2a).\\]\nSo, solutions are all integral numbers that can be represented as this above equation, but given that we want an answer in the form $\\boxed{\\text{answer}}$ the problem implies we are looking for integer solutions. $a = -1, 0, 1$ can be substituted into above equation which gives $3,0,3$ respectively. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{0, 3}$."}
