{"question": "In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.", "answer": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $$\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3} = \\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)}.$$In this representation we can immediately read that there is a hole at $x=-3$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors we have\n$$\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}.$$We can write $\\frac{x}{x+1}$ as $1 - \\frac{1}{x+1}$ which shows that as $x$ becomes very large, the graph tends towards $1$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+3+0 = \\boxed{6}.$", "agents_response": "To find the number of holes, we simplify the given equation. The simplified fraction $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$ would be $\\frac{x*(x+3)}{(x+1)*(x+3)}$. We can simplify this by getting rid of the (x+3) in the numerator and the denominator resulting in $\\frac{x}{x+1}$. Because we get rid of this term, a hole forms at x=-3. So, $a=1$.\n\nFor vertical asymptotes, we would find values that make the denominator equal zero. These usually form after the simplification and holes are gotten rid of. For our simplified fraction, the denominator becomes zero when x=-1. This means that $b=1$.\n\nHorizontal asymptotes are located by finding the limit as x approaches infinity. For this function, the limit as x approaches infinity or negative infinity equals 1. That indicates one horizontal asymptote at y=1. So, $c=1$.\n\nSince our function does not have degree of numerator strictly greater than degree of denominator, there is no slant or oblique asymptote. So, $d=0$.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem, $a+2b+3c+4d$, would be $1+2*1+3*1+4*0 = 1+2+3 = \\boxed{6}$."}
