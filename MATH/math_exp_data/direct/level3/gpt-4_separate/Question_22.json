{"question": "How many of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5?$", "answer": "We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number.", "agents_response": "The least common multiple of $3, 4,$ and $5$ is $60$. Therefore, the only positive integers that are divisible by all three of these numbers are multiples of $60$. The multiples of $60$ that are less than or equal to $100$ are: $60$ and $100$. So, \\boxed{2} of the first one hundred positive integers are divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$."}
