{"question": "Find $p+q$, given that $(q+4)(p+3)-(q+2)(p+1)=44$.", "answer": "We multiply the binomials:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(q+4)(p+3)-(q+2)(p+1)&=44\\\\\nq(p+3)+4(p+3)-(q(p+1)+2(p+1))&=44\\\\\npq+3q+4p+12-(pq+q+2p+2)&=44\\\\\n2q+2p+10&=44\\\\\n2q+2p&=34\\\\\nq+p&=\\boxed{17}\\\\\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "Starting from the given equation, we can distribute to get:\n$qp+3q+4p+12-qp-q-2p-2=44.$ Simplifying by combining like terms gives us $q+2p+10=44.$ We then subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the variables, which results in $q+2p=34.$\n\nNext, we solve for one of the variables to get an expression we can use to substitute into another equation. Solving $q+2p=34$ for $q$ gives us $q=34-2p.$\n\nSince the problem asks for $p+q$, we substitute $34-2p$ for $q$ in the expression $p+q$ to get $p+(34-2p).$ Simplifying this gives us $34-p$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\\boxed{34-p}."}
