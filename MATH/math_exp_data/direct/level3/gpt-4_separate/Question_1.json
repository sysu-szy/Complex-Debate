{"question": "How many positive integers $x$ satisfy $x-4<3$?", "answer": "Add 4 to both sides of the inequality to find $x<7$.  This inequality is satisfied by the $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers between 1 and 6 inclusive.", "agents_response": "First, we add 4 to both sides of the inequality to isolate x:\n\n$x-4+4<3+4$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$x<7$\n\nTo find the positive integers that satisfy this inequality, we start at 1 (the smallest positive integer), and continue up to 6. \n\nThe positive integers that satisfy the inequality are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So there are \\boxed{6} positive integers that satisfy the inequality $x-4<3$."}
