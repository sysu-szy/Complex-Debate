{"question": "Alice is given the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9.$ She must choose a pair of these digits, with the digits being different, to form a two-digit number. How many of the numbers she can construct will be divisible by $3$?", "answer": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers.", "agents_response": "In order to determine how many two-digit numbers can be formed that are divisible by 3, we first need to understand that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. \n\nSo let's see what sums we can get:\n\n2+3=5 is not divisible by 3.\n2+5=7 is not divisible by 3.\n2+7=9 is divisible by 3, so 27 and 72 can both be formed. \n2+9=11 is not divisible by 3.\n3+5=8 is not divisible by 3.\n3+7=10 is not divisible by 3.\n3+9=12 is divisible by 3, so 39 and 93 can both be formed.\n5+7=12 is divisible by 3, so 57 and 75 can be formed.\n5+9=14 is not divisible by 3.\n7+9=16 is not divisible by 3. \n\nTherefore, Alice can form \\boxed{6} two-digit numbers which can be divided by 3."}
