{"question": "The complex number $z$ is equal to $9 + bi$, where $b$ is a positive real number and $i^2 = -1$. Given that the imaginary parts of $z^2$ and $z^3$ are equal, find $b$.", "answer": "We compute \\[z^2 = (9+bi)^2 = 81 + 18bi - b^2\\]and \\[z^3 = 729 + 243bi - 27b^2 - b^3i^3.\\]Therefore, setting the imaginary parts equal, we get \\[18b = 243b - b^3,\\]or $b^3 = 225b$. Since $b > 0$, we can divide by $b$ to get $b^2 = 225$, and so $b = \\boxed{15}$.", "agents_response": "To solve for $b$, we first need to compute the squares and cubes of $z$.\n\nWe have $z^2 = (9 + bi)^2 = 81 + 18bi - b^2$ and $z^3 = (9 + bi)^3 = 729 + 243bi - 27b^2 - b^3i$.\n\nGiven that the imaginary parts of $z^2$ and $z^3$ are equal, we set them equal to each other, which gives us $18b - b^2 = 243b - b^3$.  Simplifying, we get $b^3 - 225b + b^2 = 0$.\n\nRearranging, $b^3 + b^2 -225b= 0$, we can factor out $b$ to get $b(b^2 + b - 225) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $b = 0$ , $b^2 + b - 225 = 0$.\n\nBecause $b$ is positive, we discard $b= 0$.\n\nBy solving the second equation, we get $b = 15 , -15$.\n\nBecause $b$ is positive, $b = 15$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is   $\\boxed{15}$."}
