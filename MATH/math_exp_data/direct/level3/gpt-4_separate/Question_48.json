{"question": "One line is described by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ k \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Another line is described by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Find $k$ so that the lines are coplanar (i.e. there is a plane that contains both lines).", "answer": "The direction vectors of the lines are $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ k \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}.$  These vectors cannot be proportional, which means that the lines cannot be parallel.  Therefore, the only way that the lines can be coplanar is if they intersect.\n\nMatching the entries in both lines, we obtain the system\n\\begin{align*}\n-1 + 3t &= 2 + u, \\\\\n-3 + kt &= 4 + 4u, \\\\\n-5 + 7t &= 6 + 7u.\n\\end{align*}Solving the equations $-1 + 3t = 2 + u$ and $-5 + 7t = 6 + 7u,$ we find $t = \\frac{5}{7}$ and $u = -\\frac{6}{7}$.  Substituting into the second equation, we get\n\\[-3 + \\frac{5}{7} k = 4 - \\frac{24}{7}.\\]This leads to $k = \\boxed{5}.$", "agents_response": "The given lines will be coplanar if the vectors connecting a point on one line to points on the other are non-coplanar. If we write the lines as r1 = < -1 , -3 , -5 > + t<3, k, 7> and r2 = <2, 4, 6> + u<1, 4, 7>, then the vector connecting a point on r1 to a point on r2 as r1 - r2 = <-3, -7, -11> +t <3, k, 7> - u<1, 4, 7> = < -3 -t + u, -7 - kt + 4u, -11 - 7t + 7u >. \n\nFor these vectors to be non-coplanar, the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors must not be equal to 0. Form the matrix and find its determinant:\n\ndet(A) =    |-3 -t + u, 3, -1|\n              |-7 - kt + 4u, k, 4|\n              |-11 - 7t + 7u, 7, 7|.\n\nHaving the determinant not equal to zero gives the condition for the lines to be non-coplanar (i.e, the lines are coplanar if and only if the determinant is equal to 0). Solving for k in the equation det(A) = 0, we get \\boxed{k=4}."}
