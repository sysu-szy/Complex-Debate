{"question": "For how many integer values of $k$ do the graphs of $x^2+y^2=k^2$ and $xy = k$ not intersect?", "answer": "Suppose the graphs $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ and $xy = k$ intersect, which means the system\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 &= k^2, \\\\\nxy &= k\n\\end{align*}has a solution.  Then\n\\[(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.\\]Expanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so\n\\[k^2 - 2k \\ge 0.\\]This is satisfied by all integers except $k = 1.$\n\nBy the same token, $(x + y)^2 \\ge 0,$ or $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0.$  Hence,\n\\[k^2 + 2k \\ge 0.\\]This is satisfied by all integers except $k = -1.$  We have found that $k = 1$ and $k = -1$ do not work.\n\nIf $k = 0,$ then $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is a solution.\n\nNow, assume $k \\ge 2.$  The point $(\\sqrt{k},\\sqrt{k})$ lies on the hyperbola $xy = k,$ and its distance from the origin is\n\\[\\sqrt{k + k} = \\sqrt{2k} \\le \\sqrt{k \\cdot k} = k.\\]Since there are points arbitrary far from the origin on the hyperbola $xy = k,$ there must be a point on the hyperbola whose distance from the origin is exactly $k,$ which means it lies on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = k^2.$\n\nFor $k \\le -2,$ the graph of $xy = k$ is the graph of $xy = -k$ rotated $90^\\circ$ about the origin, so the case where $k \\ge 2$ applies, i.e. the hyperbola $xy = k$ and circle $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ intersect.\n\nHence, the there are $\\boxed{2}$ integer values of $k$ for which the graphs do not intersect, namely 1 and $-1.$", "agents_response": "The equation of the first graph represents a circle centered at the origin with radius $k$. The equation of the second graph represents a hyperbola, which either opens up and down or left and right depending on whether $k$ is positive or negative.\n\nConsider when $k=0$. The circle degenerates into a point at the origin, and the hyperbola degenerates into the two coordinate axes, which intersect at the origin, so $k=0$ does not work.\n\nFor $k \\neq 0$, we can rewrite the equation of the hyperbola as $y = k/x$. Substitute this into the equation of the circle to obtain $x^2+(k/x)^2=k^2$. Multiply through by $x^2$ to avoid division by zero, yielding $x^4+k^2-x^2k^2=0$. This is a quadratic in $x^2$, so we can solve for $x^2$ using the quadratic formula: \n\n$x^2 = \\frac{k^2 \\pm \\sqrt{(k^2)^2 - 4*1*(k^2)}}{2*1}$\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{k^2 \\pm \\sqrt{k^4 - 4k^2}}{2}$\n\n$x^2 = \\frac{k^2 \\pm k\\sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2}$.\n\nAlso since $x^2 = (k/y)^2$, by replacing $x^2$ and simplifying, we get  \n\n$y^2 = \\frac{k^2 \\pm k\\sqrt{k^2 - 4}}{2}$.\n\nSo both $x^2$ and $y^2 > 0$. This implies that $k^2 \\pm k\\sqrt{k^2 - 4} > 0$. Solving this inequality, we see that it is satisfied for all real $k$, except for $k \\in (-2,2)$.\n\nThus, the circle and the hyperbola do not intersect for $k=0$ and $k \\in (-2,2)$. Look again at $k=\\pm2$. For $k=2$, only one point $(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{2})$ satisfies both equations. Similary, for $k=-2$, only one point $(-\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{2})$ satisfies both equations. So we do not count $k=\\pm2$.\n\nTherefore, the graphs do not intersect for $5$ integer values of $k$: $k \\in \\{-1, 1, 0\\}$ and $k=\\pm2$.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{5}."}
