{"question": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the line whose equation is $\\frac{x}4-\\frac{y}5=1$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "In slope-intercept form, the given equation becomes $y=\\frac{5}{4}x-5$.  The slope of this line is $\\frac{5}{4}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to this one is the negative of the reciprocal of $\\frac{5}{4}$, or $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}.$", "agents_response": "The given equation, $\\frac{x}{4}-\\frac{y}{5}=1$, rearranges to $y=\\frac{4}{5}x-5$. It is clear that the slope of this line is $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe slope of a line that is perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of $\\frac{4}{5}$, or $-\\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{4}}."}
