{"question": "Rationalize the denominator of: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{8}+\\sqrt{32}}$. The answer can be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{A}}{B}$, where $A$ and $B$ are integers. Find the minimum possible value of $A+B$.", "answer": "First, we simplify the denominator. $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{8}+\\sqrt{32}}=$$$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{2}+4\\sqrt{2}}=$$$$\\frac{1}{7\\sqrt{2}}$$Then, we multiply the top and bottom by $\\sqrt{2}$. $$\\frac{1}{7\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}=$$$$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{14}$$Therefore, $A+B=\\boxed{16}$.", "agents_response": "To rationalize the denominator, you can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. However, the first step is to simplify the radicals in the denominator. Since $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{7\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nNext, you rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$, yielding $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{14}$.\n\nThe minimum possible value of $A + B$ would therefore be $2 + 14 = \\boxed{16}$."}
