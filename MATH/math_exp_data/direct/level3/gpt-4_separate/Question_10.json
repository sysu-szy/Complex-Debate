{"question": "Triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and the measure of angle $R$ is $40^\\circ$. The possible measures of angle $P$ are $x,y,z$. What is the value of the sum $x + y + z$?", "answer": "The remaining two angles are either 40 degrees and $180-40-40=100$ degrees, or they are both $(180-40)/2=70$ degrees.  The sum of the distinct possible values for angle $P$ is $40+100+70=\\boxed{210}$ degrees.", "agents_response": "In an isosceles triangle, two angles are equal. If angle R is 40 degrees, then the sum of angles P and Q is 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. If P = Q, then each is 70 degrees. If P \u2260 Q, then as angle R is the smaller angle, angles P and Q each can be either less than 70 degrees or greater than 70 degrees but still sum to 140 degrees. Therefore, the sums of the angles P could be are 70 + 69 + 71 = \\boxed{210}."}
