{"question": "How many terms of the sequence $\\sqrt{1},\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{4},\\ldots$ are less than or equal to $20$?", "answer": "$20^2 = 400$, so each of the square roots up through $\\sqrt{400}$ is less than or equal to $20$. Thus, because the sequence starts at $1$, there are $\\boxed{400}$ such terms.", "agents_response": "The terms of the sequence increase as the square root of the term number. So, if we want to find the largest term that is still less than or equal to 20, we should square 20. The square of 20 is 400, which tells us that there are 400 terms of the sequence that are less than or equal to 20. \nSo, the answer is \\boxed{400}."}
