{"question": "What is the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have?", "answer": "An integer $n$ in the form $p^e$, for some prime $p$ and positive integer $e$, has $(e+1)$ positive factors. To maximize $e$, let $p=2$, the smallest prime. Since $n$ is less than 20, $e$ is at most 4, which means $n$ can have 5 factors. If $n$ is in the form $p_1^{e_1}\\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then let $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$ to find the maximum possible $e_1$ and $e_2$. Both cannot be 2 (else $n=36$), so $e_1, e_2=1, 2$ give the most factors: $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors. Finally, $n$ cannot be divisible by any other prime since $2\\cdot3\\cdot5=30>20$. Thus, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6 factors. Of course, we could have solved this problem by finding the number of factors of each positive integer less than 20, but in general our approach is more efficient.", "agents_response": "To find the positive integer less than 20 with the most distinct positive integer factors, we can manually check each number, though a shortcut is acknowledging prime factorization. \n\nThe number 1 has one factor: 1. \nThe numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 are prime and thus have two factors: 1 and the number itself. \nThe numbers 4, 9, and 16 have three factors: 1, the square root, and the number itself.\nThe numbers 6, 10, 14, 15, and 18 have four factors. \nThe number 8 has four factors: 1,2,4,8 and the number 12 has six factors: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer less than 20 with the most distinct positive integer factors is 12, with these factors being 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is \\boxed{6}."}
