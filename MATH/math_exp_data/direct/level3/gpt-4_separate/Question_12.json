{"question": "Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive?", "answer": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$.", "agents_response": "To calculate the probability, we first need to determine the number of outcomes that satisfy the condition, and then divide this by the total number of outcomes. For two six-sided dice, the total number of outcomes is 6*6 = 36.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11.\n- There is 1 way to get a sum of 3 : (1,2), (2,1)\n- There are 2 ways to get a sum of 4 : (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\n- There are 3 ways to get a sum of 5 : (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)\n- There are 4 ways to get a sum of 6 : (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)\n- There are 5 ways to get a sum of 7 : (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\n- There are 6 ways to get a sum of 8 : (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2)\n- There are 5 ways to get a sum of 9 : (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3)\n- There are 4 ways to get a sum of 10 : (4,6), (5,5), (6,4)\n- There are 3 ways to get a sum of 11 : (5,6), (6,5)\n\nThis gives us a total of 1+2+3+4+5+5+4+3+2+1 = 30 conditions.\nSo the probability is 30/36 = 5/6.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{5/6}."}
