{"question": "A cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?", "answer": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$.", "agents_response": "The area of the label is equal to the curved surface area of the cylinder, which is given by the formula 2\u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the height. \n\nFor this can, h = 6 inches, and the label area = 60\u03c0 square inches.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n60\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r*6\n\nSimplify the right side: \n\n60\u03c0 =12\u03c0r\n\nDivide both sides by 12\u03c0 to solve for r: \n\nr = 60\u03c0 / 12\u03c0 = 5 inches\n\nSo, the radius of the can is 5 inches.\n\n\\boxed{5}."}
