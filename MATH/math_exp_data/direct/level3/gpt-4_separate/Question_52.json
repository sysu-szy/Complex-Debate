{"question": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$  Let $g(x) = [f(x)]^2.$  Find the range of the function $g(x).$", "answer": "Let $y = f(x),$ so $y$ can take on any value from $-3$ to 5, inclusive.  Then $y^2$ can take on any value from 0 to 25, inclusive.  (If we take any value from $-3$ to 0 and square it, we get a value from 0 to 9.  And if we take any value from 0 to 5 and square it, we get a value from 0 to 25.)  Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[0,25]}.$", "agents_response": "The range of the function $f(x)$ is $[-3,5].$ This means that the output of the function is always within these values, inclusive.\n\nWhen we square each value in the range of $f(x)$ to find the range of $g(x)$, we find the smallest and largest possible square values.\n\nThe smallest square value occurs for $f(x) = 0$, because $0^2 = 0$.\n\nThe largest square value could occur for either $f(x) = -3$ or $f(x) = 5$, because when we square either of these values, we get $9$ or $25$ respectively. Therefore, the maximum is $25$.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $g(x)$ is $[0,25]$. \n\nSo, the answer is \n\n\\boxed{[0,25]}."}
