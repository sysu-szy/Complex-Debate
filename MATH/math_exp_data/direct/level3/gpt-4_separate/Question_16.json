{"question": "Two different positive numbers $a$ and $b$ each differ from their reciprocals by $1$. What is $a+b$?", "answer": "If a positive number $x$ differs from its reciprocal by 1, then either $x - \\frac{1}{x} = 1$ or $\\frac{1}{x} - 1 = 1.$\n\nIf $x - \\frac{1}{x} = 1,$ then\n\\[x^2 - x - 1 = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula,\n\\[x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]We want $x$ to be positive, so $x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nIf $\\frac{1}{x} - x = 1,$ then\n\\[x^2 + x - 1 = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula,\n\\[x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]We want $x$ to be positive, so $x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nHence,\n\\[a + b = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}.\\]", "agents_response": "We are given that $a$ and $b$ each differ from their reciprocals by $1$. This can be set up as the following two equations:\n\n$a - \\frac{1}{a} = 1$\n\n$b - \\frac{1}{b} = 1$\n\nWe can solve these quadratic equations by making one side equal to 0, which gives us:\n\n$a^2 - a - 1 = 0$\n\n$b^2 - b - 1 = 0$\n\nSolving these quadratic equations using the quadratic formula ($x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$), we get:\n\n$a = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n\n$b = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n\nWe know that $a$ and $b$ are different, so one of them will be the positive root and the other will be the negative. Adding these two together, we get:\n\n$a + b = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} + \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1$\n\nSo, \\boxed{1} is the value of $a + b$."}
