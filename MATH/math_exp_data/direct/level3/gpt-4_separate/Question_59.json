{"question": "Consider the circle defined by the equation $x^2 +6x +y^2 +8y =0$.  Find the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle.", "answer": "We complete the square for the equation by observing that the given equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2+6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16)=25,\n\\] so the equation for the circle becomes \\[\n(x+3)^2 +(y+4)^2 =5^2.\n\\]  Hence, the center is $(-3,-4)$ which implies that the answer is $-3-4 =\\boxed{-7}$.", "agents_response": "First, we will complete the square in order to rewrite this equation in a form where the center of the circle is obvious.\n\nFor the x terms, we can factor out an x and then add the square of half the coefficient of x inside the parentheses, which is (3)^2 = 9. We get x^2 +6x +9 = (x+3)^2 and we must add 9 to keep the equation balanced.\n\nFor the y terms, we can do the same thing, yielding y^2 +8y +16 = (y+4)^2, and we will need to add 16 to the other side as well.\n\nSo our completed square form of the equation is:\n\n(x+3)^2 +(y+4)^2 =25\n\nIn this form, the coordinates of the center of the circle are given by the terms in the parentheses, but with the signs flipped, so the center is at (-3,-4). The sum of these coordinates is -3-4 = \\boxed{-7}."}
