{"question": "A two-digit integer is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$. What is the greatest possible value of $n$?", "answer": "We are looking for the greatest possible value of the digit $n$, so let's see if $n=9$ is a possibility. 99 is divisible by 9, so the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.", "agents_response": "The greatest possible value of $n$ that could be the last digit of a two-digit integer and also be a factor of that number is 8. A number ending in 8 that is also divisible by 8 is for example, 48. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $n$ is \\boxed{8}."}
