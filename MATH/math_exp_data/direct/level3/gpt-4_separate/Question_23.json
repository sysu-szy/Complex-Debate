{"question": "How many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?", "answer": "In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": "To be divisible by 4, a number must end in either 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32... etc. These are all counted by multiples of 4. But we are only interested in those numbers that are multiples of 4 and have a 2 in the units place.\n\nThe first such number is 12 and the last is 192. The numbers are: 12, 32, 52,...,192. If we divide each by 4, we get: 3, 8, 13,...,48. This is an arithmetic sequence and we can find its length by subtracting 3 from 48, which gives us 45. Then we add 1 to account for the first term, which gives us 46. \n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{46} numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4."}
