{"question": "How many of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4 and 5?", "answer": "The least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is $3\\cdot4\\cdot5=60$, so we must find how many multiples of 60 are less than 500.  These multiples of 60 are $1\\cdot 60, 2\\cdot 60, \\ldots 8\\cdot 60$.  Thus, $\\boxed{8}$ of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5.", "agents_response": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4 and 5 is 60. This means that every 60th number in the list of positive integers is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTo find how many of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 60, we simply divide 500 by 60.\n\nThe quotient (rounded down) is our answer because we're looking for fully divisible counts and not a fraction.\n\nSo, 500 divided by 60 is 8 with a remainder.\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{8} of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5."}
