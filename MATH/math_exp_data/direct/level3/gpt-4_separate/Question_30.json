{"question": "Simplify $\\sqrt{64^3}$.", "answer": "\\[\\sqrt{64^3}=\\sqrt{(2^6)^3}=\\sqrt{2^{18}}=2^9=\\boxed{512}.\\]", "agents_response": "The square root of $64^3$ is the same as taking the cube root of 64 and then squaring that result. \n\nThe cube root of 64 is 4 (since $4^3 = 64$). If we square that result, we get $4^2 = 16$.\n\nSo, $\\sqrt{64^3}$ simplifies to \\boxed{16}."}
