{"question": "Find the positive difference between the solutions to the equation $6t^2 + 30 = 41t$.", "answer": "Rearranging the equation gives $6t^2 -41t + 30 = 0$.  Factoring gives $(t-6)(6t-5)= 0$, so the solutions to the equation are $t=6$ and $t=\\frac{5}{6}$.  The positive difference between these solutions is $6 - \\frac56 = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{6}}.$", "agents_response": "We can rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n\n$6t^2 - 41t + 30 = 0$\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n$t^2 - \\frac{41}{6}t + 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $at^2 + bt + c = 0$, so we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\n$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nSubstitute $a=1$, $b= -\\frac{41}{6}$, and $c=5$ to the formula:\n$t=\\frac{\\frac{41}{6}\\pm \\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{6})^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$\n$t=\\frac{\\frac{41}{6}\\pm\\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}}{2}$\n\nFind the positive difference between the solutions:\n\nLet $t_1 = \\frac{\\frac{41}{6} +\\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}}{2}$ and $t_2 = \\frac{\\frac{41}{6} -\\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}}{2}$\n\n$t_1 - t_2= [\\frac{\\frac{41}{6} +\\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}}{2}] - [\\frac{\\frac{41}{6} - \\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}}{2}]= \\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20}$\n\nSo, the positive difference between the solutions is $\\sqrt{(\\frac{41}{3})^2-20} \\approx \\fbox{4.5505}$."}
