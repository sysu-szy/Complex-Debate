{"question": "Find the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250. Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "answer": "Since $1,\\,2,\\,3,\\ldots,250$ is an arithmetic sequence, the mean of all of the terms is equal to the mean of the first and last terms. (To see this, remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.)  So the mean is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+250) = \\boxed{125.5}$.", "agents_response": "The mean (or average) of a list of numbers is found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by the number of numbers. \n\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 250 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is (n/2)*(first number + last number), where n is the number of numbers. \n\nHere, n is 250, the first number is 1, and the last number is 250. Plugging these into the formula gives (250/2)*(1 + 250) = 125*251 = 31375. \n\nDivide this by the number of numbers (250) to find the mean: 31375 / 250 = 125.5.\n\nSo the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250 is 125.5.\n\n\\boxed{125.5}."}
