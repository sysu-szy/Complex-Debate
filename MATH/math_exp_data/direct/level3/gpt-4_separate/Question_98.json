{"question": "I have a bag with yellow and blue marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. If I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 7:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I added more?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$. Additionally, after we add blue marbles and remove yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be x+5 and y-3 respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $7:3$, so $\\dfrac{x+5}{y-3}=\\dfrac{7}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $3x=4y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x+5)=7(y-3)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=12$, $x=16$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before more were added, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{16}$.", "agents_response": "Before adding and removing marbles, let the number of blue marbles be 4x and the number of yellow marbles be 3x.\n\nIn the end, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the number of blue marbles will be 4x + 5 and the number of yellow marbles will be 3x - 3.\n\nSo we have the equation (4x + 5) / (3x - 3) = 7 / 3\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 4. \n\nSo before adding or removing any marbles, there were 4 * 4 = 16 blue marbles in the bag. \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{16}."}
