{"question": "If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers such that $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, what is the value of $A+B+C$ given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1?", "answer": "Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the right hand side of the given equation by $\\sqrt{3}$, we have \\[\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C}=\\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{6}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] Thus, $A=3$, $B=3$, and $C=2$, so $A+B+C=3+3+2=\\boxed{8}$.", "agents_response": "The RHS simplifies to $\\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{6} =\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Hence, $\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which makes clear that $A=3$, $B=3$ and $C=2$ ($\\sqrt{B}$ is clearly $\\sqrt{3}$, implying $B=3$; then $C=2$ follows from the denominator). Thus, the answer to the problem is $3+3+2 = \\boxed{8}$."}
