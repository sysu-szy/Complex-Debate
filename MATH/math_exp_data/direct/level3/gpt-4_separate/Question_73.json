{"question": "Mrs. Read can knit one pair of children's mittens with a ball of yarn six inches in diameter. How many pairs of identical mittens can she knit with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter? Assume that the balls of yarn are rolled consistently.", "answer": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.", "agents_response": "The volume of a sphere (which we can assume the shape of the ball of yarn to be close to) is determined using the equation V = 4/3 * \u03c0 * r^3. In this case, the radius is half of the diameter. Thus, when we double the diameter, we are actually multiplying the volume by 2^3 = 8. So, Mrs. Read can knit 8 times as many pairs of mittens with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter. If one 6-inch ball of yarn makes 1 pair of mittens, then a 12-inch ball of yarn makes 8 pairs of mittens.\n\n\\boxed{8}."}
