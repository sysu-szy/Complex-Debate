{"question": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line that passes through the point $(2,-3)$ and has slope $\\frac12$?", "answer": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$.", "agents_response": "The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since we know that the line has a slope of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and passes through the point $(2,-3)$, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for $b$.\n\nWe get:\n\n$-3 = \\frac{1}{2}(2) + b$\n\n$-3 = 1 + b$\n\n$b = -3 - 1 = -4$\n\nHence, the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line is  \\boxed{-4}."}
