{"question": "How many distinct positive integers can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\\}$?", "answer": "Since all of the integers are odd, the differences between any pair of them is always even. So, $13 - 1 = 12$ is the largest even integer that could be one of the differences. The smallest positive (even) integer that can be a difference is 2. So, the integers include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ integers.", "agents_response": "We are asked for the number of distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the given set. We are allowed to repeat numbers. The possible differences include 2 (from 3-1, 5-3, 7-5, etc.), 4 (5-1, 7-3, etc.), 6, 8, 10, and 12. Using 1 as our starting number, we can see that the number of possibilities increases by 1 for each subsequent number in the set. So, there are total 6 distinct positive integers. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{6}."}
