{"question": "The midpoint of the line segment between $(x,y)$ and $(-9,1)$ is $(3,-5)$. Find $(x,y)$.", "answer": "Applying the midpoint formula gives us $$\\left(\\frac{-9+x}{2},\\frac{1+y}{2}\\right)=(3,-5).$$Solving $\\frac{-9+x}{2} =3$ for $x$ and solving $\\frac{1+y}{2}=-5$ for $y$, we find the coordinates $(x,y)$ to be $\\boxed{(15,-11)}$.", "agents_response": "The formulas to find the midpoint are $x_{m} = \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}$ and $y_{m} = \\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}$, where $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ are the coordinates of the points and $(x_{m}, y_{m})$ are the coordinates of the midpoint. We know that $(x_{m}, y_{m}) = (3, -5)$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (-9, 1)$, so we can set up equations to solve for $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (x, y)$:\n\\[\\frac{x(-9)}{2} = 3 \\rightarrow x + (-9) = 2 * 3 = 6 \\rightarrow x = 6 + 9 = 15\\]\n\\[\\frac{y + 1)}{2} = -5 \\rightarrow y + 1 = 2 * -5 = -10 \\rightarrow y = -10 - 1 = -11\\]\nSo, $(x, y) = (15,-11)$.\nThis simplifies to \\boxed{(15,-11)}."}
