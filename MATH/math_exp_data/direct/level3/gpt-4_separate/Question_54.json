{"question": "Bobby stands 10 feet from Sam, and Eric stands 8 feet from Bobby. What is the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam?", "answer": "Eric is on the circle of radius $8$ centered at Bobby.  The closest point on this circle to Sam is where it intersects the line segment between Bobby and Sam. If Eric is on this line segment, the minimum of $10-8=\\boxed{2}$ feet is obtained.", "agents_response": "Since the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, if Bobby, Sam, and Eric line up in this order: Sam, Bobby, Eric, the distance Eric from Sam would be the sum of the distance from Sam to Bobby and Bobby to Eric: 10 feet + 8 feet = 18 feet. \n\nHowever, if the order is Sam, Eric, Bobby where Eric is between Sam and Bobby, Eric could be closer to Sam. If we subtract the distance from Bobby to Eric from the distance from Sam to Bobby, we get: 10 feet - 8 feet = 2 feet. \n\nTherefore, the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam is \\boxed{2}."}
