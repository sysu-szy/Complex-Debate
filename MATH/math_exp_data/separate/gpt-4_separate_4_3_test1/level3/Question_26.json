{"question": "Rick is thinking of a positive factor of $14$ and Steve is thinking of a positive factor of $42$.  If Rick and Steve are thinking of the same number, how many possible numbers could they be thinking of?", "answer": "We will find the positive divisors of 14 by finding pairs that multiply to 14.   We begin our list as follows, $$1 \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 14.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\\cdot 7=14$, so our list becomes $$1 \\quad 2 \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 7 \\quad 14.$$  Checking $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$, we find that none of these are divisors of $14$, so our final list is $$1 \\quad 2 \\quad 7 \\quad 14.$$  Next, we use the buddy method to determine the factors of $42$.  We begin our list as follows, $$1\\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 42.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\\cdot 21=42$, so our list becomes $$1\\quad 2 \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 21 \\quad 42.$$  Checking $3$, we find that $3\\cdot 14=42$, so our list becomes $$1\\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 14 \\quad 21 \\quad 42.$$  Checking $4$ and $5$ we find that $4$ and $5$ are not divisors of $42$.  Checking $6$, we find that $6\\cdot 7=42$, so our list becomes $$1\\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 6 \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad \\dots \\quad \\underline{\\hphantom{10}} \\quad 7 \\quad 14 \\quad 21 \\quad 42.$$  Since $7$ is already on our list, our final list is $$1\\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 6 \\quad 7 \\quad 14 \\quad 21 \\quad 42.$$  We compare our lists for the factors of $14$ and the factors of $42$ to see that the factors that $14$ and $42$ share are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $14$.
