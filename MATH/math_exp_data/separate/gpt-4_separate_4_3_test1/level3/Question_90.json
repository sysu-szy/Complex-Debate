This is easily checked using the Pythagorean Theorem. We know that a triangle with side lengths $a, b, c$ is a right triangle if and only if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where a,b and c correspond to the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse. In this case, we have that $8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289$, and we also have $17^2 = 289$. Thus, since both sides of the equation are equal, triangle $ABC$ is indeed a right triangle with $AC$ as its hypotenuse.\n\nThis is especially significant because now we can apply a special property of circles: that the diameter of a circle is exactly equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed within the circle. In other words, if we have a right triangle inside a circle such that the hypotenuse of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, then the length of the diameter is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. This is sometimes referred to as the Inscribed Angle Theorem.\n\nSince we know that $AC$ is the hypotenuse of triangle $ABC$ and that $AC$ is also the diameter of the circle, we have that the radius of the circle is equal to the diameter divided by $2$. \n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle is $17/2 = \\boxed{8.5}.$", "round 1": "First, we identify the shape and nature of the triangle, $ABC$.

This confirms that triangle $ABC$ is indeed a right triangle as $8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289$, which is indeed equal to $17^2$. \n\nNext, we know that the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed in a circle is equal to the diameter of the circle, following the Thales' theorem or the Inscribed Angle Theorem. This theorem states that in a circle, any angle with its vertex on the circle and endpoints on the circle (an inscribed angle) will have a degree measure exactly half the degree of the arc it intercepts, making the angle subtend by the diameter of the circle a right angle, as the intercepted arc is a semicircle (180 degrees). Hence, the hypotenuse $AC$ is the diameter of the intended circle. \n\nFinally, the radius of the circle is half the diameter.
