The area of the gray figure is equal to the area of one of the smaller squares (which belongs entirely inside each square) plus the total area of the three inner squares.\n\nThe side length of each smaller square is half of the larger square, which means it is 6/2 = 3 units. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the smaller square is 3^2 = 9 square units.\n\nThe side length of each inner square is half of the smaller square length, which means it is 3/2 = 1.5 units. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of one inner square is 1.5^2 = 2.25 square units.

However, they disagree on how to calculate the grey area.\n\nUpon review, the mistake in my own reasoning was in incorrectly identifying the size of the inner squares. Instead of being half the size of the smaller squares (as I originally estimated), they should be one third the size, based on the division made by the overlapping squares. \n\nThis means the side length of each inner square is 6/3 = 2 units. The area of one inner square is therefore 2^2 = 4 square units. Since there are three inner squares, their total area is 3 * 4 = 12 square units.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the grey area should be the sum of the area of the smaller square and the total area of the inner squares. \n\nThat being said, the area of the smaller square is correct at 9 square units (from 3^2), and the total area of the inner squares is 12 square units (as corrected).\n\nIn this case, the correct gray area would be 9 + 12 = \\boxed{21 square units}.", "round 2": "Yes, based on the diagram we can see that the grey area consists of a square and six right triangles, three of them are smaller (with a side length of 2 units) and the other three are larger (with a side length of 4 units). \n\nThe area of the square (which is grey) can be calculated as side^2, or 2^2 = 4 square units. \n\nThe area of each of the smaller triangles is calculated as (1/2)*base*height, or (1/2)*2*2 = 2 square units.

There are three of these larger triangles, thus their total area is 3*8 = 24 square units. \n\nThe total grey area is simply the sum of the areas of the square and the six triangles, being 4 + 6 + 24 = \\boxed{34 square units}."}, {"round 0": "First, we should analyze what the question is asking. The gray figure is made up of sections of each of the three squares. However, as a more straightforward way to measure the area, we could also see the figure as having the same total extent as a single square with all four corners (each one-quarter of a square) removed.\n\nTo proceed, we first calculate the area of one of the squares. Area is calculated with the formula side length squared. So if a side of our squares measures 6, the squares' areas would be 6 * 6 which equals 36 square units. \n\nNext, consider the corners of this square. Each corner is a one-quarter section of a 6 unit by 6 unit square, or in other words, a smaller square with a side of length 3 unit. So, if we calculate the area of these smaller squares using side length squared (3*3), we get 9 square units per corner.\n\nThe gray figure falls exactly where the corners are removed. So we can simply subtract the combined area of the corners from the area of the square. There are four corners, each with an area of 9 square units, so the combined area of the corners is 4 * 9 which equals 36 square units.\n\nFinally, we subtract the combined area of the corners from the area of the square to get the area of the gray figure: 36 - 36. This means that the area of the gray figure is \\boxed{0} square units.", "round 1": "From the solutions of the agents, it is noted that my initial solution was incorrect. Upon careful review, I see that I made an error in interpreting the problem. My mistake was in thinking that the grey area represented the area of the main square where the corners had been removed, which implies that the grey area would be zero. But it's clear from the image that this is not the case. Now, considering the helpful input from other agents, let me re-evaluate the problem correctly.\n\nFrom the diagram, it is clear that the grey area is made up of sections of three overlapping squares.\n\nThe first step to determine the grey area is to calculate the area of three equal squares where each square has a side of length 6 units. The area of each square is side^2, which is 6^2 = 36 square units. So the total area of the three squares overlapping each other is 3*36, which equals 108 square units.\n\nHowever, it can be observed that the portions of the three squares that are not shaded in grey (the small squares) are not part of the grey area. Each of these squares is one-fourth the size of the larger square in the diagram (formed by the intersecting midpoints of two sides of each of the squares). So, each small square would have a side length of half that of the larger square, or 3 units. The area is therefore 3^2 = 9 square units.\n\nAs there are three small squares, the total combined area of the small squares is 3 * 9 = 27 square units.\n\nWe can now find the grey area by subtracting the combined total area of the small squares from the combined total area of the three main squares. That is, 108 - 27 = \\boxed{81} square units.\n\nThis should be the correct answer to the problem presented. The logic and calculations appear to be consistent, and the answer is appropriately simplified.", "round 2": "Given the solutions of the agents, we will first resolve the conflicts and then recalculate the solution of the problem.\n\nUpon reevaluating my original solution, I still lean towards the approach I used. The grey area is made up of parts of three overlapping squares. Each square has a side of length 6 units, and the total area of the three squares is thus 3*(6^2) = 108 square units.\n\nHowever, the grey area doesn't include the portions of the three squares that are not shaded, and these add up to three small squares - one removed from each square. As accurately observed, the sides of these smaller squares correspond exactly to the length from the midpoint of one side of the square to the midpoint of an adjacent side. Thus, they are half as long as the sides of the larger squares and their length is 3 units. \n\nThe small squares each have an area of 3^2 = 9 square units and therefore, the total area of these small squares is 3 * 9 = 27 square units.\n\nSubtracting the total area of these small squares from the total area of the three squares, we get the area of the grey region, which is: 108 - 27 = \\boxed{81} square units.\n\nThough the solutions by other agents provide alternative ways of working the problem, this approach seems to be the most direct and clear. Therefore, I believe that the area of the gray figure is indeed \\boxed{81} square units."}, {"round 0": "The grey area is composed of 8 triangles and 1 square\n\nEach square has a side length of 6 which is divided into 3 segments forming 2 equal triangles(when one square overlaps another) and a square. This is easier to see if you look at the figure diagonally.\n\nThe equal triangles in each square (3 squares in total) are right angled triangles so the area is simply (base times height)/2. For every square, the base and height are 2-thirds of the side length since the side length is divided into 3 equal parts (you can think of the triangles as splitting the 6 units into three 2-unit sections). Therefore the area of each triangle is ((6 * 2/3) * (6 * 2/3))/2 = 8/3 square units.\n\nSince each square gives us 2 triangles, and there are 3 squares in total, we have 2 * 3 = 6 triangles. Multiplying this by the area of one triangle gives the total area for the triangles: 6 * 8/3 = 16 square units.\n\nThe square in the middle of the grey figure is a smaller square that's part of each of the 3 larger squares. Based on the way the larger squares overlap, we can determine the side length of this smaller square to be 2 (since it's one-third of the larger square's side length). Thus its area is side length times side length, or 2 * 2 = 4 square units.\n\nThe total gray area is therefore: sum of all triangle areas + square area, = 16 + 4 = \\boxed{20} square units.", "round 1": "Upon reevaluating the solutions provided by the other agents, I still believe my method to be the most accurate.\n\nThe figure is comprised of 8 same-sized triangles and a square. \n\nEach triangle is a right triangle with base and height equal to two-thirds of the length of the large square (each square having a side length of 6 units), as the sides intersect at the midpoints. Therefore, each triangle has an area of (1/2)*(2/3)*6*(2/3)*6 = 8/3 square units. \n\nThere are two such triangles for every square, and with three squares in total, that gives us 6 triangles. The total area of the triangles is therefore 6*(8/3) square units = 16 square units. \n\nFor the smaller square in the center of the figure, its sides intersect at a length of 2 units (a third of the side of the larger squares). The area of this square is then 2*2 = 4 square units.\n\nSo, we have the total gray area as the sum of the areas of 6 triangles and the square: 16 + 4 = \\boxed{20} square units. \n\nTherefore, my updated solution remains the same as my initial one, i.e., \\boxed{20} square units.", "round 2": "Reflecting on the responses of the other agents and taking in their judgments, I must acknowledge an error on my part. Upon reevaluating, it is a mistake on the number of triangles. The correct number of triangles is not six, rather eight.\n\nCorrecting the earlier calculation, each triangle has an area of (1/2)*(2/3)*6*(2/3)*6 = 8/3 square units. \n\nWith eight triangles present in total, following the correction, the total area of these eight triangles is 8*(8/3) = 64/3 square units, or approximately 21.333 square units.\n\nThe center square has side lengths of 2 units (1/3 of the side of a larger square) and an area of 2^2 = 4 square units.\n\nThus, the total gray area is the sum of the areas of 8 triangles and the square: 21.333 + 4 = \\boxed{25.333} square units.\n\nThis is my updated solution.

Furthermore, each region covers exactly one half of the corresponding square, for the following reason. The region is formed from the whole square by subtracting four half-square parts situated in the corners. These form two whole squares together. Hence, the remainder is also two whole squares, but as it is spread over the entire square, it must be a half-square. As each of the three original squares is identical, the gray region covers a total of 1.5 of the original squares.\n\nThe size of each square is calculated using the formula for the area of a square (s^2), where s is the length of one side. Consequently, the area of each square is 6^2 = 36 square units.\n\nAs the gray area equals to 1.5 of the original squares, its size is 1.5 * 36 = 54 square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the gray figure in square units is \\boxed{54}.", "round 2": "Upon reading through all the agents' solutions, I have analyzed each one of them carefully. Upon critical evaluation and insight, I realize that the correct solution follows from this observation: \n\nThe gray area can be constructed by taking 3 squares, each of side length 3 (half of 6), and then adding 1 more square (the overlapping center), of side length 2 (one third of 6). \n\nCalculating the area for each of these constructs gives us:\nArea of one of the three main squares = 3^2 = 9 square units.\nThe total area from these three is therefore 3 * 9 = 27 square units.\n\nThe area of the center square (formed at the intersection of the three main squares) is 2^2 = 4 square units.\n\nSo, the gray area, calculated as the sum of these areas, equates to 27 + 4 = \\boxed{31} square units.
