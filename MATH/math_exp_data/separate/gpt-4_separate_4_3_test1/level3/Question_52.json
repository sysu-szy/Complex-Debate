This means the function $f(x)$ can output any real number between -3 and 5 (inclusive). The function $g(x)$ squares the output of $f(x)$, so let's consider what happens when we square numbers in the range $[-3,5]$.\n\nIf we square any real number, the resulting number is always positive or zero. So we know that the range of $g(x)$ only consists of positive numbers or zero. \n\nLet's further analyze the way squaring distorts the range $[-3, 5]$. \n\n(1) What is the smallest square in the range $[-3,5]$? Well if we square $0$, we get $0$ but if we square any number above $0$, the square is always positive. And if we square any negative number, the square is again always positive. So square never decreases the value below $0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $g(x)$ is $0$.\n\n(2) What is the largest square in the range $[-3,5]$? Here we need to compare the square of $-3$ and $5$. Indeed, $(-3)^2=3^2=9$ and $5^2=25$. Thus the maximum value $g(x)$ can obtain is $25$.\n\nIn other words, for $g(x)$, the minimum value in its range is $0$ and the maximum value is $25$.

For the function $f(x)$, its output can be any real number between $-3$ and $5$ inclusive. When we square these output values to get function $g(x)$, all negative numbers become positive due to a property of a square of any number being non-negative. Hence, the lowest value for $g(x)$ has to be $0$.\n\nEvaluating the Minimum Value:\n\nA square of any number cannot be a negative number. Therefore, the minimum $g(x)$ value is $g(x) = [f(x)]^2 = [0]^2 = 0$. \n\nEvaluating the Maximum Value:\n\nNext, to ascertain the maximum value that $g(x)$ can yield, we need to evaluate $g(x)$ using the highest absolute value from the range of $f(x)$. In this case, $5$ has the highest absolute value, and will yield the highest square, i.e., $g(x) = [f(x)]^2 = [5]^2 = 25$. \n\nTherefore, the range of $g(x)$ will include all output values it can provide between and including these two extremes i.e., $0$ to $25$. \n\nAll these findings lead us to conclude that the range of the function $g(x)$ is \\boxed{[0, 25]}.", "round 2": "Taking into account the analysis provided by other scholars and rigorous mathematical reasoning, I am confident to reaffirm my solution.\n\nInterpretation:\n\nWe are given a function $f(x)$ with a range $[-3,5]$, meaning the output of this function falls within this interval. We then consider another function $g(x)$ which is the square of the function $f(x)$. We are tasked with determining the range of this new function.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nStep 1 - Minimum Value of $g(x)$:\n\nThe square of a number, whether it is positive, negative, or zero, will always be non-negative. In other words, it will be either positive or zero. Therefore, the smallest value that $g(x)$ can generate is $0$, and this occurs when $f(x)$ is $0$.\n\nStep 2 - Maximum Value of $g(x)$:\n\nThe maximum value of $g(x)$ will occur when $f(x)$ is at its maximum absolute value from its range. In the range of $f(x)$, which is $[-3, 5]$, the maximum absolute value is $5$. Squaring $5$ results in a maximum value for $g(x)$ of $25$.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFrom the above, we can gather that $g(x)$ yields all values from the minimum $0$ to the maximum $25$, inclusive. Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ would be all possible outputs it can provide from these two extremes, that is $[0, 25]$.\n\nAccording to these considerations, my original conclusion remains unchanged.

The range of a given function is the set of all possible outputs. In this case, the range of f(x) is given as [-3,5], meaning the function f(x) can output any real number between -3 and 5, inclusive.\n\nThe function g(x), as given, is the square of the function f(x), i.e., g(x) = [f(x)]^2. So, what does squaring a number do? Essentially, it always returns a non-negative number. That means, g(x) will always be at least 0 since squaring any real number, regardless of whether it's positive or negative, returns a non-negative number.\n\nNow to find the maximum possible value for the function g(x), we look at the extreme values in the range of f(x). Squaring -3 gives us 9 and squaring 5 gives us 25. Since square function starts from the lowest value of 0 (when the input is 0) and grows without limit as the input value grow in either direction, the maximum value must come from the farthest value from 0 which is 5.

The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = [f(x)]^2$. Simply put, every output from $f(x)$ is squared to get the corresponding output for $g(x)$.\n\nIt is well known that squaring any real number will always give a non-negative result. The smallest value a squared real number can have is zero. Therefore, we can safely say that the minimum value for $g(x)$ is $0$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $g(x)$, we must consider the highest value that comes out of squaring any output from $f(x)$. The largest absolute number in the range of $f(x)$ is $5$, and $5^2=25$.
