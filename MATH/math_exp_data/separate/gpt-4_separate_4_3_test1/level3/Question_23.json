{"question": "How many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?", "answer": "In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\\boxed{10}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let us first break down the problem into two parts. \n\nThe first condition specifies that we are looking for numbers with 2 in the unit's place. This means the numbers can be 2, 12, 22, 32....and so on up to 192 (the largest multiple of ten that\u2019s less than 200) +2. \n\nThe second condition specifies that they also need to be divisible by 4. For a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4. So, if the units place is already 2, for our number to be divisible by 4, the tens place must end with a number that, when paired with 2, creates a multiple of 4. The possible tens digits are therefore 0 (for 2), 2(for 22), 6(for 62), and 8(for 82).\n\nCounting the sequence of 0(2), 2(22), 6(62), 8(82), we see that there are four terms between 1 to 10. This sequence repeats between each successive 10's. As we want to find the number till 200, we get 20 sets of 10's within the range. \n\nSo in these 20 sets, the quantities of our chosen numbers (2, 22, 62, 82) repeat 20 times. \nSo the total amount will be 20(the amount of sets between 1 to 200) times 4 (number of terms in a set) = 80.\n\nSo, there are 80 numbers that fit the condition between 1 and 200.

These numbers indeed end with 2 but the critical check is whether they are divisible by 4. \n\nA number is divisible by 4 when the last two digits of the number combined make a multiple of 4. In this case, we are looking for numbers ending with 2 which are divisible by 4. This narrows down the options further to 12, 32, 52, 72, 92, 112, 132, 152, 172, and 192. These are the only numbers that meet both conditions.\n\nCounting these terms, it is evident that there are \\boxed{10} such numbers from 1 to 200.

This suggests we need to consider numbers in the format 10n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer. \n\nStep 2 - We also need these numbers to be divisible by 4. For a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4. For numbers ending with 2, this further limits the options to those where the tens place is an even number. \n\nStep 3 - Combining the conditions from Step 1 and Step 2, the possible numbers must follow this pattern: 20n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer. Considering the range between 1 and 200, the maximum value of n is 9.\n\nThus, the numbers that satisfy both conditions are: 12, 32, 52, 72, 92, 112, 132, 152, 172, and 192. \n\nCounting these numbers, we find that there are \\boxed{10} numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units' place and are divisible by 4.

The maximum value of n within the given range must be no larger than 19 because 10(19) + 2 = 192, and 10(20) + 2 = 202 is outside the given range of 1 through 200.\n\nHowever, we also need these numbers to be divisible by 4 - which involves looking at the last two digits of the number.

The number must have 2 in the unit's place.\n2. The number must be divisible by 4.\n\nStarting with the first requirement, we find numbers that end with 2.

This forms the sequence: 2, 12, 22, 32, ..., 192. These numbers all end with 2 - our first condition.\n\nHowever, these numbers must also conform to our second condition - they must be divisible by 4. The divisibility rule for 4 states that if the last two digits of a number form a number that is divisible by 4, then that original number is divisible by 4.\n\nApplying this rule, we arrive at the sequence: 12, 32, 52, 72, 92, 112, 132, 152, 172, and 192. These are all part of the original sequence but they also satisfy the condition of being divisible by 4.\n\nTo get the total count of numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4, we count these numbers and find we have 10 such instances.\n\nThus, upon revisiting my answer with a critical eye I must agree with Agents 1 and 2.

A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.\n\nTo examine such numbers, we have to check the numbers that end with 2, and have an even number before 2, i.e., numbers like 12, 32, 52....,192. \n\nAs the second last digit varies from 1 to 9 for ten times, within the limit of 200, and since the number must be an even number, we consider only 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as the second digit.
