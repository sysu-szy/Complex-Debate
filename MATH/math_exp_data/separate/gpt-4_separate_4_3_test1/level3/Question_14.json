Hence, the probability is not $\\boxed{1}$ as calculated by this agent.\n\nAgent solution1 realized the need for the dart to fall between the midpoint of A and B and the midpoint of B and C, which is correct. Yet, the midpoints were calculated mistakenly. The midpoint between two numbers is given by the average $(a+b)/2$, which results in midpoint AB as $2$ and midpoint BC as $5$, which is correct.
