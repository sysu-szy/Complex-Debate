For this case, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $4$, of $y^2$ is $16$, of $x$ is $-16$, of $y$ is $96$, and the constant is $144$.\n\nAll we need to do is complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms. For $x$, we want to make a square of the form $(x \u2013 h)^2 = x^2 -2hx + h^2$, and for $y$, we want to make a square of the form $(y \u2013 k)^2 = y^2 -2ky + k^2$.\n\nStarting with $x$, we have $4x^2-16x$. We factored out $4$ to obtain $4(x^2-4x)$. The next step is to add and subtract squares to complete the square. The rule to calculate the term that will complete the square is to divide the coefficient of $x$ by 2 and square it, that is, $(-4/2)^2=4$. We obtain $4[(x^2-4x+4)-4]$.
