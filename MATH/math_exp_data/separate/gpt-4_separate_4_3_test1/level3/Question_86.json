The area of triangle OAB is 1/2 *abs(a*b) = 4 as A is on x axis and B is on y axis. Likewise, we calculate the areas of triangles OAC and OBC to get the coordinates of OA, OB and OC. Then, we calculate the lengths of AB, AC, and BC using the Pythagorean theorem and get Area(ABC) = 1/2 * AC * BC.

I mistakenly interpreted the geometrical meaning of Pythagorean theorem into a calculation formula about the absolute value of areas. Instead, we should interpret a, b and c as lengths in a 3D space.

So, the Cartesian coordinates of A, B and C are (4sqrt(6), 0, 0), (0, 8sqrt(3), 0) and (0, 0, 6sqrt(8)), respectively. \n\nThen we can get the length of AC to be sqrt((8sqrt(3))^2 + (6sqrt(8))^2) = sqrt(192 + 288) = 16sqrt(3).\n\nThen we can use the formula of the area of a triangle where one angle is right-angled, which is 1/2 * product of the lengths of the two sides that include the right angle. \n\nHence, Area of ABC = 1/2 * AB * BC = 1/2 * 4sqrt(6) * 8sqrt(3) = 16sqrt(2) = \\boxed{16\\sqrt{2}}.", "round 2": "My initial approach to solve the problem by considering the absolute values and appling Pythagoras theorem was incorrect.

Hence, abs(a*c) = 2 * 6 = 12...(Equation 2). \n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle OBC (located at YZ plane) would be 1/2 * abs(b*c) = 12. Hence, abs(b*c) = 2 * 12 = 24...(Equation 3).\n\nRound 3:\nNext, let's calculate the area for triangle ABC. To find this area in a 3D plane, we use vector cross product as area = 1/2 * abs(A\u00d7B), where \u00d7 denotes vector cross product and A and B are position vectors of points A and B.\n\nPosition vectors for A, B and C with respect to origin O, would be A = a*i, B = b*j and C = c*k, where i,j,k are the unit vectors in direction of x,y and z axises respectively.\n\nNow, area of triangle ABC can be given by 1/2 * abs(B\u00d7C + C\u00d7A + A\u00d7B). \n\nRound 4:\nWhen we solve B\u00d7C, it yields -b*c*i. Similarly, C\u00d7A yields -a*c*j and A\u00d7B yields -a*b*k. \n\nSo, now our area expression becomes 1/2 * abs((-b*c*i - a*c*j - a*b*k).\n\nThe magnitude of this vector can be calculated by square root of the sum of squares of the coefficients of i, j and k. \n\nRound 5:\nWhen we substitute Equation 1, 2 and 3 in this, the area expression becomes Area = 1/2 * \u221a((24^2) + (12^2) + (8^2)). \n\nFinally, we calculate this to get Area = 14. \n\nSo, the area of triangle ABC in a 3D plane is \\boxed{14}.", "round 1": "Let's reconsider the solutions above that I and the other agents have provided.\n\nThe point A = (a, 0, 0), B = (0, b, 0) and C = (0, 0, c) are correct positions for the points A, B, and C in the 3D plane. \n\nAnd the calculations I made based on the formula for the area of a triangle in a 3D plane, 1/2 * abs(A\u00d7B), were also correct. I found the cross-products B\u00d7C (-b*c*i), C\u00d7A (-a*c*j), and A\u00d7B (-a*b*k) correctly. \n\nBut, there's a mistake I made in the calculation steps that needs to be corrected. \n\nIn Round 3, the area of triangle $ABC$ is given by 1/2 * abs(B\u00d7C + C\u00d7A + A\u00d7B). \n\nIn Round 4, I calculated B\u00d7C as b*c*i instead of bppropriate -b*c*i. Obviously, similar sign mistakes happened for C\u00d7A and A\u00d7B. \n\nSo, the corrected vectors after cross-product should be b*c*i, a*c*j, and a*b*k. \n\nThe result vector after adding all these three vectors would be (b*c*i + a*c*j + a*b*k). \n\nThe magnitude of this vector, which represents the area of triangle ABC, will be: \n\nArea of Triangle $ABC$ = 1/2 * \u221a{ | b*c |^2 + | a*c |^2 + | a*b |^2 } \n\nReplace | a*b | = 8, | a*c | = 12 , | b*c | = 24 \n\nArea of Triangle $ABC$ = 1/2 * \u221a{ (24)^2 + (12)^2 + (8)^2 }\n\nArea of Triangle $ABC$ = 1/2 * \u221a{ 576 + 144 + 64 }\n\nArea of Triangle $ABC$ = 1/2 * \u221a{ 784 }\n\nSo, the Area of Triangle $ABC$ = 1/2 * 28 = 14\n\nTherefore, the correct area of triangle ABC in this 3D plane is \\boxed{14}.", "round 2": "The points A, B, and C lie on the x, y, and z axis respectively which implies A = (a, 0, 0), B = (0, b, 0) and C = (0, 0, c), for some real numbers a, b, and c. Hence, A, B, and C are indeed orthogonal to each other since they each lie on the axis which are orthogonal to each other. \n\nGiven the areas of triangles OAB, OAC, and OBC are 4, 6, 12 respectively, we have:\n\n1/2 * |a| * |b| = 4, \n\n1/2 * |a| * |c| = 6,\n\n1/2 * |b| * |c| = 12.\n\nWe can then solve these equations and obtain:\n\n|a| * |b| = 8,\n|a| * |c| = 12,\n|b| * |c| = 24.\n\nBecause we are considering areas, we should think of a, b, c as positive real numbers and can ignore the absolute values.\n\nHence we can solve these equations and get\n\na = 8 / b,\nb = 24 / c,\na = 12 / c => c = 12 / a => c = 12 / (8/b) => c = 1.5b.\n\nAnd we have b = 24 / (1.5b) => b = sqrt(24 /1.5) = 4,\na = 8 / 4 = 2,\nc = 1.5 * 4 = 6.\n\nHence, the Cartesian coordinates of A, B, and C are (2, 0, 0), (0, 4, 0), and (0, 0, 6) respectively.\n\nNow we have to calculate the area of Triangle ABC. We can first get the coordinates of point AB which is (2-0, 0-4, 0-0), i.e., AB = (2, -4, 0). Similarly, we can get AC = (2, 0, -6). The area of Triangle ABC is half the length of the cross-product of AB and AC:\n\nAB \u00d7 AC = (0*6 - (-4)*(-6), 0*2 - 0*6, 2*0 - (-4)*2) = (-24, -12, 8).\n\nHence, the area of Triangle ABC = 1/2 * sqrt(the square sum of each coordinate of the cross-product vector) = 1/2 * sqrt((-24)^2 + (-12)^2 + 8^2) = 1/2 * sqrt(576 + 144 + 64) = 1/2 * sqrt(784) = 1/2 * 28 = \\boxed{14}."}]}
