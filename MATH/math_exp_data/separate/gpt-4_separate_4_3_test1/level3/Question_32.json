It is clearly a power of $2$ and this power of $2$ changes when $N-1$ reaches the power of $2$. This situation happens when $N$ becomes $2^k$ where $k$ is a natural number greater than 0 ($N=2,4,8,16,32,64,\\ldots$). \n\nBetween these values, the function $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ remains constant.

We can start from $N=19$, and increase it by one until the right side equals to the left side. Note that the left side changes when $N=2^k+1$. Keep in mind that if $N=X$ is a solution where $2^k+1 < X < 2^{k+1}+1$, then $N=2^{k+1}+1$ is not a solution because $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ will be doubled at $N=2^{k+1}+1$. \n\nStart with $N = 20$. We find that the left side equals 32 because $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor = 4$, but this is not equal to $N + 19$. \n\nHowever, when checking $N=21$, we see that the left side is still $32$ ($2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor} = 32$) and this equals to $N + 19$ now, which means the smallest possible solution for $N$ is $21$.\n\nIf we continue to check this for $N$ in $22, 23, 24, \u2026$ up to $N=31$, all of these values for $N$ are solutions.\n\nAt $N=32$, left side becomes 64 because $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor = 5$, and 64 is no longer less than $N + 19$, so we have to start checking for different values of $N$ from this point forward.\n\nChecking for $N$ between 33 and 63, we find no solutions. However, at $N=64$, left side jumps again to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}=128$, so we need to look for second smallest possible solution of $N$ in $64 < N < 128$.\n\nChecking for $N$ in $65, 66, 67, \u2026$ in order, we find that the second smallest possible value of $N$ is $N=85$ where $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}=128=N+19$. \n\nSo, the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$ for the given conditions is $21 + 85 = \\boxed{106}$.\n\nI recognize a potential source of error in the third agent\u2019s solution: the attempt to forecast when $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ reaches beyond $N + 19$ is flawed, which resulted in incorrect possible value predictions of $N$ and thus a unjustifiably high sum of $75$. \n\nIn the first agent\u2019s solution, the interval predictions for $N$ were also inaccurate, leading to incorrect possible smallest values for $N$ and a final sum of $47$. \n\nIn the second agent\u2019s solution, the break down of the central formula when $N$ reaches the power of $2$ was misunderstood, leading to an under-anticipated jump in value of $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$, resulting in undeclared solutions in the significant interval of $21 \u2264 N < 32$ and a cumulative sum of $64$.

We can then try inserting the values in our function until we find two solutions. \n\nAs we mentioned before, the smallest possible value of $N$ which satisfies $f(N)=19$ is found just before the next power of two $2^{k+1}=32$. If we start counting from $N=31$ downward, we get $f(31)=32-31=1, f(30)=32-30=2, ..., f(22)=32-22=10, f(21)=32-21=11$. We have found that $f(21)=11$ is less than $19$, so we went too far. The smallest possible value of $N$ that satisfies $f(N)=19$ is therefore $N=22$, because $f(22)=19$.\n\nThe second smallest possible value of $N$ that satisfies $f(N)=19$ is found just before the second next power of two $2^{k+2}=64$. If we start counting from $N=63$ downward, we get $f(63)=64-63=1, ..., f(42)=64-42=22, f(41)=64-41=23$. Here also, we have found that $f(41)=23$ is greater than $19$, so we went too far. The second smallest possible value of $N$ that satisfies $f(N)=19$ is therefore $N=42$, because $f(42)=19$.\n\nThus, the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$ such that $f(N)=19$ is $22+42=\\boxed{64}$.", "round 1": "Upon revisiting my solution and comparing it with those of other agents, I notice that my solution differs significantly from others. My sum of the smallest two possible values is $\\boxed{64}$, whereas most of the other agents calculated it as $\\boxed{47}$, $\\boxed{48}$, or $\\boxed{75}$.\n\nLet's verify the different solutions by adding insight from each agent:\n\nAgent0 defined intervals for $N$ based on the values of $log_{2} (N-1)$ and subsequently worked on reducing and simplifying the equation. They also trial and tested the values of N, finally concluding the smallest possible values as $23$ and $24$ and so their sum as $47$. This is indeed a plausible solution, but the agent didn't consider that for $N \\in [2^k,2^{k+1})$ the value of $1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ equals $k+1$, hence next smallest value after $23$ could be in the interval starting from $2^{k+1}$, not necessarily within the same interval. \n\nAgent1 simply went by a rather straightforward approach by directly checking values, beginning from $2$, for the equation until they found two matching ones. They found $21$ and $27$, which does meet the equation and hence concluded their sum as $48$. This is a correct solution.\n\nAgent2 had a trial and error approach, deriving the smallest values as $37$ and $38$. However, considering the nature of our function $f(N)$, these values seems too large. Given that $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ resets to next power of 2 going from $2^{k}$ to $2^{k+1}$, having both smallest values in same exact interval would bring about a very large difference $19$, not a characteristic of function $f(N)$.\n\nIn my method, I noted the workings of function $f(N)$ and how it increases and then resets to zero at each power of 2. Using this, I determined an interval wherein the solution lies. Checking through the values, the smallest two solutions I found were $22$ and $42$ and hence the sum as $64$. After careful analysis of the function and its nature, I am confident that my solution was correct. \n\nMoreover, It has been shown that when $N$ equals a power of 2, the number of elite players goes back to zero, so the function has local maxima at each $2^{k+1}-1$. The maxima grow with growing $k$, starting from 2 at $k=1$, 4 at $k=2$, 8 at $k=3$, and so on. Given the function values are always less than $2^k$, and we sort for $2^{k}$ to find right $k$, and we're looking for the numbers with function values of $19$, it would make sense that our function hits 19 at the values after hitting the local maxima of $2^{k}$, hence the interval from $2^{k}$ to $2^{k+1}$, and not between local maxima as agent suggested.\n\nThus, relying on my solution and approach and having critically analyzed solutions of other agents, I confirm my solution \\boxed{64} to be correct.", "round 2": "Upon revisiting the problem, I recognized that I erred in my initial approach after taking into account the insights provided by the agents' solutions.\n\nFirstly, I failed to correctly understand the cyclic nature of the function that is used in this problem during my initial analysis. It becomes clear upon further inspection that the function $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2}(N-1) \\rfloor}$ only changes its value in the instances where N is a power of 2. Outside of these points, this function maintains a constant value. Due to this, the difference of $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2}(N-1) \\rfloor}$ and N does not change for values of N which fall between two consecutive powers of 2, except at N being a power of 2 where this difference abruptly jumps down or up. Thus, if for a certain value of N, the equation $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2}(N-1) \\rfloor}-N = 19$ holds true, any other value of N in the same interval between two consecutive powers of 2 and greater than the valid value of N will also satisfy this equation.\n\nTherefore, the first plausible approach seems to be finding the smallest N that satisfies the equation. For values starting from N=20, it is easy to find that N=21 satisfies the equation. Due to the properties of the function outlined above, all the values from 21-31 will also satisfy the equation as they lie in the same interval of consecutive powers of 2.\n\nAccording to the nature of the function, the next smallest value of N would be in the next interval of consecutive powers of 2 i.e., between 32 and 64. Again, one can find that the smallest value of N in this interval that satisfies the equation is 85. And again, due to the properties of the function, all the values from 85-127 should satisfy the equation.\n\nHence, the lowest two values of N that satisfy the equation are 21 and 85. So, the sum of the two smallest possible values of N that satisfy the equation is $21+85=\\boxed{106}$, which is the correct solution."}]}
