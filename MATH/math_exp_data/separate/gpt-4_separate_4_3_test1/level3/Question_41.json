So there is 1 hole.\n\nA vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is 0 (and that value of x is not also a zero in the numerator). Here, the factor $(x+1)$ makes the denominator 0, so we have a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. Looking back at the original function(just to ensure the x-value x = -1 is not a hole), the same x-value does not make the numerator 0, so x = -1 is not a hole, verifying that x = -1 is indeed a vertical asymptote. Therefore, we have only 1 vertical asymptote.\n\nTo determine the horizontal or oblique asymptote, we compare the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator with that in the denominator.

A hole in the graph occurs when a factor in the denominator of a rational function is also a factor in the numerator.

So we have a common factor of $(x+3)$ in both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore, we have one hole in the graph. This means $a = 1$.\n\nNext, let's find the vertical asymptotes. A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator of a rational function is zero, leaving the function undefined. In this case, the denominator is zero when $x = -3$ and $x = -1$. We have already determined that $x = -3$ corresponds to a hole, so we have a remaining vertical asymptote at $x = -1$. This means $b = 1$.\n\nFor horizontal and oblique asymptotes, we need to consider the degree of the polynomial in both the numerator and the denominator. If the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$. If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the coefficients of the highest degree term.

Factoring $x^2+3x$ gives us $x(x+3)$ and factoring $x^2+4x+3$ yields $(x+1)(x+3)$. The common factor $x+3$ in both implies there is 1 hole in $x=-3$, so $a=1$.\n\nNext, to find the vertical asymptotes, we look at values that make the denominator zero and that are not also zeros of the numerator. Factoring the denominator gives $(x+1)(x+3)$, which puts zeroes at $x=-3$ and $x=-1$. As we identified $x=-3$ as a hole with the above procedure, we are left with 1 vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, so $b=1$.\n\nNow let's find the horizontal asymptotes. The degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal (both are 2). When the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is found by dividing the leading coefficients of the highest degree term in the numerator and denominator. In this case, that's $1/1=1$, so there is 1 horizontal asymptote, so $c=1$.\n\nLastly, since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, there are no oblique asymptotes.

Consequently, $a=1$. \n\nThe denominator $(x+1)(x+3)$ equates to zero when $x=-1$ or $x=-3$. But $x=-3$ is the location of a hole, not a vertical asymptote. So we have one vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, hence $b=1$.\n\nFirstly, let's look for any horizontal asymptotes. A rational function has a horizontal asymptote if the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal. For this function, both the numerator and denominator are of degree 2, which means there is a horizontal asymptote. The location of the horizontal asymptote is determined by dividing the coefficients of the highest degree terms in the numerator and the denominator.

These are both vertical asymptotes because substituting them into the numerator of the fraction does not yield zero, so $b = 2$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the holes. Holes occur when a zero of the denominator is also a zero of the numerator, which is not the case in this problem. So, $a = 0$.\n\nTo find the horizontal or oblique asymptotes, we need to compare the degree of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator. Here, the degrees are equal (both are 2).

We determine these by factoring both the numerator and the denominator. Factoring the numerator $x^2+3x$ gives us $x(x+3)$, and factoring the denominator $x^2+4x+3$ provides $(x+1)(x+3)$. From this, it becomes clear that they have a common factor, $(x+3)$, which when cancelled creates a hole in the graph at $x=-3$, meaning $a=1$.\n\nIn order to find vertical asymptotes, we look at where the denominator equals 0, while the numerator doesn't.

This gives us one vertical asymptote, which means $b=1$.\n\nNext, to solve for the number of horizontal asymptotes, we see that the degree of the polynomial in the numerator equals the degree of the polynomial in the denominator.
