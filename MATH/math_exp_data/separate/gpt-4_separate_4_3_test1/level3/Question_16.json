Thus, this problem seems to have no valid solution as the premise that $a$ and $b$ are different positive numbers, each of which differ from their reciprocal by $1$, does not seem to hold true.\n\nBut, let's analyze it from a different perspective. In the problem, the phrase \"differ from their reciprocals by 1\" means the absolute value of the difference between the number and its reciprocal is 1, that is $|x - 1/x| = 1$. Then the two equations would be:\n\n1) $|a - 1/a| = 1$ \n2) $|b - 1/b| = 1$\n\nFrom here, the equation $x - 1/x = 1$ and the equation $x - 1/x = -1$ can be obtained. The roots of the first equation are $(1 \\pm \\sqrt{5})/2$, and the roots of the second equation are $(1 \\mp \\sqrt{5})/2$.

This means that $a$ and $b$ cannot be the same root from the same equation. Therefore, we must have $a$ and $b$ as roots from different equations. \n\nFor example, we could choose $a = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2$ from the first equation, and $b =(1 - \\sqrt{5})/2$ from the second equation.
