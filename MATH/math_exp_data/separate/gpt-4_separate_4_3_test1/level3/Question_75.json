Based on the information given, we can form two equations to represent the two scenarios:\n\n1) For the one-hour job, Mr. Wrench charges $N + x(1) = 97$.\n\n2) For the five-hour job, he charges $N + x(5) = 265$.\n\nThis creates a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values for $N$ and $x$.\n\nRound 2: Subtracting the equations\n\nTo solve the equations simultaneously, we can subtract the first equation from the second to get $N + 5x - N - x = 265 - 97$ or $4x = 168$. Solving this equation gives $x = 42$.\n\nRound 3: Substituting x into the first equation\n\nNow that we know $x$, we can substitute it into the first equation to find $N$. Plugging $x = 42$ into $N + x(1) = 97$ gives $N + 42 = 97$ or $N = 55$.\n\nRound 4: Determining the charge for a two-hour job\n\nWith both $N$ and $x$ known, we can now calculate how much Mr. Wrench would charge for a two-hour job. Inserting $N = 55$ and $x = 42$ into $N + 2x$ gives $55 + 2(42) = 139$.\n\nRound 5: Concluding remarks\n\nTherefore, Mr. Wrench would charge $\\$139$ for a two-hour repair job. \n\nSo the final result is \\boxed{139}.", "round 1": "We start with the given that Mr. Wrench charges a fixed rate $N$ to visit the home and an hourly rate $x$. The total cost is therefore $N+xh$, where $h$ is the number of hours worked. From the problem statement, we know he charges $97 for a one-hour job ($N + x(1) = 97$), and $265 for a five-hour job ($N + x(5) = 265$). \n\nWe can solve these two equations for $N$ and $x$ simultaneously. If we subtract the first equation from the second, we get $4x = 168$. Solving this gives $x = 42$.\n\nNext, we substitute $x = 42$ back into the first equation to solve for $N$. We find that $N = 55$.\n\nGiven $N = 55$ and $x = 42$, we can calculate the charge for a two-hour job using the formula $N + xh$.

Thus, we have the equation\n\n$97 = N + 1x$\n\nSimilarly, for a five-hour job, he charges $265$ dollars.
