If $k < 0$, the equation $xy = k$ represents a hyperbola opening downwards and upwards (i.e., with vertices along the y-axis) while $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ represents an empty set because the square of a real number is always nonnegative and cannot be equal to a negative number, which $k^2$ is.

If $k > 0$, the graph of $xy = k$ is a hyperbola opening left and right (with vertices along the x-axis), while $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$ is a circle centered at the origin with radius $k$. If we substitute $y = k/x$ into the equation of the circle, we get $x^2 + (k^2/x^2) = k^2$, or equivalently $x^4 - k^2x^2 + k^4 = 0$, which is a quadratic equation in terms of $x^2$ that always has real solutions because $k^4$ is always greater than or equal to $4*k^2*k^2$.

So for k=0, there exists an intersection point, therefore we exclude it.\n\nIf k is positive, the circle and hyperbola intersect.

We need to find for how many integer values of k the graphs of these two equations do not intersect. \n\nRound 2: Visualize the Problem\nWe can start by visualizing the problem. For a smaller value of k, both the circle and the hyperbola graphs are smaller; as k gets larger, both graphs get larger. The two graphs intersect when the k-value is such that the circle and hyperbola meet at least at one point. If the circle is completely inside the hyperbola or outside the hyperbola, the two graphs do not intersect.\n\nRound 3: Analyze the Equations\nThe equation of a circle is given by $x^2+y^2=k^2$, where the radius of the circle is |k|. The equation of the rectangular hyperbola is given by $xy = k$.\n\nFor both graphs to not intersect, the smallest value the hyperbola can take on (i.e., at x=1) must be greater than the largest value the circle can take on (i.e., at x=k). This means that there are no intersections when |k| < 1. Furthermore, the circle will also not intersect the hyperbola for |k| > 1, because at x=k, the value of the circle (x^2 + y^2 =k^2) is always larger than the hyperbola (xy=k), which means the circle is outside the hyperbola. \n\nIn summary, for integer values of k, there will be no intersections for k > 1 or for k < -1. \n\nRound 4: Find the Number of Non-intersecting K\nNow that we know the ranges of k for which the graphs do not intersect, we need to find how many integer values fall in these ranges. The integers greater than 1 are 2, 3, 4, ... to infinity, and the integers less than -1 are -2, -3, -4, ... to negative infinity.\n\nSince k can take on infinitely many values in the positive and negative direction, we cannot count the total number of such k. \n\nSo the final answer is a bit tricky. It is technically infinite. Recall that our initial conditions didn't place any bounds on the value of k, so it could be any integer.
