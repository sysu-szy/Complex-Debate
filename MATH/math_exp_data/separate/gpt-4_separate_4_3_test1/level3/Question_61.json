The result is 1 remainder 5, which means, in terms of weekdays, to go back by 12 days is equivalent to going back by 5 days. \n\nAccording to our weekday structure, when we go back by 5 days from Friday, we are then at Sunday. Therefore, the first day of any month which includes a Friday the 13th is \\boxed{{Sunday}}.", "round 1": "Sure, every month, the 13th day falls exactly 12 days after the first day of the month. Knowing that a week has 7 days, we can divide these 12 days into 1 week and remainder 5 days. \n\nIf we envision weeks as a repeating cycle, we would notice that going 1 week back or forth does not change the day of the week (if today is Monday and we go 7 days back, we will land on a Monday again). Effectively, in the cyclic sense, it is as if we did not move at all. Therefore, our primary concern is about the remaining 5 days. \n\nIf the 13th day is a Friday, going 5 days back from it, we land on a Sunday. So, the first day of a month in which the 13th is a Friday will be a \\boxed{{Sunday}}.", "round 2": "Assessing my former conclusion and the approaches of my collaterals, it appears we are in agreement. Looking into the problem, it is asked that we find out what the date of the first of a month would be if the thirteenth day of that month fell on a Friday.\n\nIn addressing this question, the groundwork is the repetitive configuration of a 7-day week. Thus, we only need to consider the days of the week in a cyclic manner where every 7 days, the pattern starts again.\n\nAcknowledging that the 13th is a Friday, we aim to find 12 days prior to this, which is to move back from Friday the 13th to the 1st day of the month.\n\nHere, modulo arithmetic comes into play where we consider the remainder when 12 days are divided by 7 days (a week). That leads to a remainder of 5. This effectively means that we have to move 5 days back from Friday.\n\nStarting from Friday and counting backwards, the fifth day would be Sunday. Thus the first day of any month which has a Friday the 13th would be a \\boxed{{Sunday}}."}, {"round 0": "Firstly, you should know that in a week there are 7 days and each day corresponds to a number. For example, you might consider Monday as day 1, Tuesday as day 2, ..., and Sunday as day 7.\n\nGiven Friday the 13th, we can consider Friday as the reference day. This means Friday is the 13th. We need to find what day is the 1st.\n\nTo do this, we subtract the day number from 13. If this number is greater than 7, we subtract 7 until we have a number between 1 and 7. This number will be the day of the week for the 1st day of the month. \n\nSo, 13 - 1 = 12. \n\nSince 12 is greater than 7, we subtract 7 to get 5.\n\nSo, the 1st of the month falls on the 5th day of the week. If we had defined Monday as day 1, then the 5th day of the week would be Friday.

Because there are 7 days in a week, we consider the number of whole weeks plus any remaining days. For 12 days, there is 1 whole week (7 days) and 5 additional days.\n\nCounting backwards from Friday by 5 days, we land on Sunday.

The logic behind the solution relies on our understanding of how weeks cycle. \n\nStarting from the 13th day being a Friday, we need to trace back by 12 days to reach the first of the month. \n\nA week consists of 7 days, so every 7th day from a given day will be the same. This is because the days of the week follow a 7-day cycle. Therefore, when calculating 12 days back, we can ignore the full weeks since they do not change the day. It's similar to moving in a circle, if you move by its full circumference or multiples of it, you end up at the same spot where you started.\n\nSo, we only need to consider the remainder when 12 is divided by 7, that is, 12 mod 7 which equals 5.\n\nNow, counting backwards 5 days from Friday, we get: Thursday (1), Wednesday (2), Tuesday (3), Monday (4), Sunday (5).\n\nHence, if the 13th day of a month is a Friday, the 1st day of that month is inevitably a Sunday. \n\nSo, the answer to the question is \\boxed{Sunday}."}, {"round 0": "To determine the day of the week of the first day of the month in a month with Friday the 13th, we can work with calendar knowledge.\n\nIn our Gregorian calendar, the days of the week proceed in a repeating cycle of seven.

This means that every 7th day from a given day will always be the same day. So, we can simplify this problem using the principle of modulo arithmetic. \n\nIn this case, we know that the 13th is a Friday. Hence, we want to calculate the day that is 12 days before Friday. \n\nSince we know that the days of the week cycle every 7 days, to find what day it was 12 days ago, we can find the remainder (modulo) when 12 is divided by 7, because every week has 7 days. This equals 5 which means that 5 days before a given day would be equivalent to going back 12 days. \n\nTo find out the 1st day of the month, we simply step back 5 days from Friday the 13th, which gives us Sunday.

This means that if we have a fixed point in time\u2014in this case, the 13th day of the month being a Friday\u2014and we wish to travel backwards in time to find the day of the week 12 days prior, then we can subtract multiples of 7 from 12 until we reach a number less than 7.\n\nThis is based on the principle that moving seven days forwards or backwards not change the day of the week. In our specific scenario, we're interested in the remaining five days once we have subtracted the whole week from the 12 days.\n\nWhen we consider these remaining 5 days and move 5 days back from a Friday, we land on Sunday.

When you move forward or backward in time by a multiple of 7 days, you will land on the same day of the week because 7 days is 1 week.
