By the identity \\((a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2\\), we get \\(a - b = -\\sqrt{2}\\). But after looking at the expression again, the solution seems incorrect. \n\nLet's correct the mistake:\n\n\\[a^2 - b^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to \\[-\\sqrt{2}\\].\n\nSo,\n\\[a - b = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{a + b},\\]\n\nand the denominator \\(a+b\\) reduces to 0, so our expression now looks like: \n\\[a - b = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{0}.\\]\n\nAs division by zero is undefined in mathematics, there must be a flaw in the calculation or understanding. We are not allowed to cancel the expression in the denominator just because they seem to be cancelling each other, the actual case might be different, considering the radical expressions.\n\nLet's revisit the problem.\n\nYet again, considering the expression in the form of $a\\pm b$, our given problem is \\(a-b\\), for \\(a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\). \n\nWe set this expression into the formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$ and replace it with our actual problem.\n\nWe are trying to simplify the expression \\(a - b\\).\n\nRound 4:\n\nLet's re-evaluate \\(a^2 - b^2\\):\n\n\\[a^2 - b^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side simplifies to \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nSo, we have \\(a^2 - b^2 = -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nSince \\(a^2 - b^2\\) can be rewritten as \\((a - b)(a + b)\\),\nwe have \\((a - b)(a + b) = -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nFrom the original problem, we are looking for the value of \\(a - b\\). \n\nSo, to isolate \\(a - b\\), we divide both sides of the equation by \\(a + b\\), giving us:\n\n\\[a - b = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{a + b} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}}.\\]\n\nSince the numerator of the right side of the equation is negative and a negative number divided by a positive number is always negative, The value for \\(a + b\\) reduces to zero. This is because the terms inside the radical of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are conjugates and their sum equals to zero,  hence the denominator of the fraction is 0. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. Hence, it implies that either there is a mistake in the above calculations or the given expression is invalid.\n\nOn revisiting the calculations, it is seen that all of them followed logical and arithmetic rules. Therefore, it seems that the expression we were given is indeed invalid under regular maths rules. \n\nSo, the conclusion is \\boxed{\\text{Invalid Expression}}.", "round 2": "Upon reviewing the other solutions as well as my initial solution, I realize that there was indeed an error in the calculation of \\(a^2 - b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I would like to correct my mistake and revisit the problem: \n\n1. Define \\(a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\).\n\n2. Form the difference \\(a - b\\) and the sums \\(a + b\\). \n\n3. Calculate \\(a^2 - b^2\\) which equals to \\(-2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=-\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n4. According to the identity \\((a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2\\), it is obvious that \\(a + b = 0\\), because the terms under the square root in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are conjugates of each other and their sum equals to zero. So we have \n\n\\[(a - b)(a + b) = -\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\n5. Substitute \\(a + b = 0\\) into this equation gives:\n \n\\[(a - b)0 = -\\sqrt{2},\\]\n\nHence, the term \\((a - b)\\) becomes equal to \\(-\\sqrt{2}/0\\), which means we are dividing by zero. In mathematics, division by zero is undefined, meaning there isn't a real answer. This implies that there is an error in the above computations or the problem itself is flawed. In revisiting the computations, it can be seen that all of them were valid and followed mathematical rules.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the solutions presented by other agents, if the computations above are correct, the expression given in the problem is invalid under regular maths rules.\n\nSo, the conclusion is \\boxed{\\text{Invalid Expression}}."}]}
