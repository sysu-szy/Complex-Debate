So, we need to borrow from the leftmost digit. \n\nWhen we borrow, we work with base 7. Thus, our 2 becomes 2 + 7 = 9(base 10), or 12(base 7).\n\nNow, let's subtract:\n\n12(base 7) - 5(base 7) = 7(base 7) or 5(base 10)\n\nSo, we write down 5.\n\nNow, since we borrowed from the leftmost digit of the minuend, we need to subtract 1 from it:\n\n1(base 7) - 1(base 7) = 0(base 7)\n\nTherefore, $126_7 - 54_7 = 052_7.$\n\nHowever, leading zeros are usually dropped in number representation, our final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{52_7}.\n\nThe subtraction was done exactly as in decimal arithmetic, except that carrying and borrowing are governed by the base (7) system.

The challenge lies in the fact that when we perform subtraction in a base that is not 10, it can seem strange because we are accustomed to decimal (base 10) arithmetic operations.

Conceptually, we add 7 to 6, and decrement the corresponding tens digit. In base-10, this would be equivalent to adding 10 to the number and decrementing the digit to the left (in tens place).
