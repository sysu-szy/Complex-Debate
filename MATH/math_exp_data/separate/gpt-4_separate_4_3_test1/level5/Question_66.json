Then the equation becomes:\n\\[ f(x) f(x) = f(x-x) = f(0) \\]\n\nThis shows that $f(x)^2 = f(0)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, each square of $f(x)$ equates to the same constant value, which is $f(0)$.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring $f(0)$\nConsidering the magnitude restrictions (as observed from the prior formula $f(x)^2 = f(0)$):\n1. If $f(0) = 0$, then $f(x)^2 = 0$ implies $f(x) = 0$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This function indeed satisfies our original equation:\n\\[ f(x) f(y) = 0 = f(x - y) \\]\n\n2. If $f(0) \\neq 0$, then $f(x)$ could possibly be constant $\\neq 0$. Suppose $f(0) = c \\neq 0$. Then $f(x)^2 = c$. The solutions to this are $f(x) = \\sqrt{c}$ or $f(x) = -\\sqrt{c}$. However, to satisfy $f(x)f(y)=f(x-y)$ for all $x, y$, $f(x)$ must be the same value for all $x$. So, $f(x)$ must be either $\\sqrt{c}$ for all $x$ or $-\\sqrt{c}$ for all $x$.\n\n### Exploration for $c \\neq 0$:\nUsing $f(x) = k$ as a constant value for all $x$, substituting in the given functional equation:\n\\[ f(x)f(y) = k^2 = f(x-y) = k \\]\nThis gives $k^2 = k$. Solving $k^2 - k = 0$, we get $k(k-1) = 0$, yielding solutions $k = 0, 1$.\n\n### Conclusion with possible $f(x)$ solutions:\n- $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n- $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\n### Finding specific $f(2017)$:\n- If $f(x) = 0$, then $f(2017) = 0$.\n- If $f(x) = 1$, then $f(2017) = 1$.\n\nThus, the only possible values of $f(2017)$ are $0$ and $1$.\n\n### Answer:\n\\[\\boxed{0, 1}\\]", "round 1": "### Reanalysis of the Functional Equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$\n\nI will revisit the approach and conclusions drawn from my solution and incorporate insights from other presented solutions to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy.\n\n#### Step 1: Consider Basic Functional Values\nSetting $y = 0$ in the equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$ yields:\n\\[ f(x)f(0) = f(x) \\]\nIf $f(0) \\neq 0$, we can safely divide both sides by $f(0)$, leading to:\n\\[ f(0) = 1 \\] \nsince any non-zero $f(x)$ simplifies to $f(x) = f(x)$, which is trivial.\n\n#### Step 2: Analysis for $f(0) = 0$\nIf $f(0) = 0$, then plugging this value back in:\n\\[ f(x)f(y) = f(x-y) \\]\n\\[ f(x)f(x) = f(0) = 0 \\]\nThis implies $f(x)^2 = 0$ for any $x$, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n#### Step 3: Exploration When $f(0) = 1$\nGiven that $f(0) = 1$, substitute $x = y$, we get:\n\\[ f(x)f(x) = f(x - x) = f(0) = 1 \\]\nThus, $f(x)^2 = 1$ which suggests $f(x)$ could be either $1$ or $-1$ for any $x$. This satisfies the original equation trivially as both $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$ and $(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$ equate to $f(0) = 1$.\n\n#### Step 4: Considering Constant, Non-Zero Solutions\nIn re-examining constant solutions:\n\\[ f(x) = c \\]\n\\[ c^2 = c \\]\nfrom which $c = 0$ or $c = 1$.

Substituting:\n\\[ f(x)f(y) = (-1)(-1) = 1 = f(x-y) \\]\nThis is consistent only if we assume $f(x-y) = 1$ always, implying a conflict unless the function oscillates or varies. Exploration into cases where $f(x)$ alternates between $1$ and $-1$ without more constrained rules is unclearly supported by pure functional equation analysis alone.\n\n### Updated Conclusions\n- If $f(x) = 0$, then $f(2017) = 0$.\n- If $f(x) = 1$, then $f(2017) = 1$.\n- If consistently, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = -1$, then $f(2017) = -1$. This constant function satisfies the functional equation, but was not fully embraced in my initial analysis due to overlooking consistently applying $-1$ across all values without varying.\n\n**Updated Answer after Critical Reassessment:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\n\\]\n\nThis incorporates and corrects previous limitations in the understanding of the constant value solution set.

We then have:\n\\[ f(x)f(0) = f(x - 0) = f(x). \\]\nAssuming $f(x) \\neq 0$ for some $x$ (we will examine the possibility of $f(x) = 0$ later), we can divide both sides by $f(x)$ to find:\n\\[ f(0) = 1. \\]\nIt's important to note here that if $f(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ (since any $x$ always gives $f(x) = f(x) \\cdot 0$). Thus, one solution is $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Plugging in Other Values\nNow, since we know $f(0) = 1$, let's try substituting $x = y$:\n\\[ f(x)f(x) = f(x - x) = f(0) = 1. \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ f(x)^2 = 1 \\implies f(x) \\in \\{1, -1\\} \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Exploring the Implications of Discrete Values\nWe know a function that switches between $1$ and $-1$ can be consistent with our equation, but let's explore if there's a pattern or constraint imposed by our functional equation. Consider plugging in $f(x) = -1$ for some specific values and checking:\nIf $f(x) = 1$ always or $f(x) = -1$ always, then obviously $f(x)f(y) = 1$ or $1 = f(x-y)$ (or similarly for $-1$), which is consistent.\n\nHowever, suppose $f(x)$ varies (oscillates) between 1 and -1. Given $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$, let's assume $f(x) = 1$ and $f(y) = -1$. If $f(y) = -1$:\n\\[ f(x)f(y) = 1\\cdot(-1) = -1 = f(x - y) \\]\nthen $f(x - y) = -1$. It seems that variations in the value of $f$ seem to be determined uniquely based on the combination of inputs, necessitating a deeper pattern or rule set.\n\n### Step 4: Exploring Specific Constraints or Further Detailing\nSince it\u2019s not simple to determine exact distributions of $1$ and $-1$ within $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given equation without further constraints or specifications, and since constant functions $f(x) = 1$ and $f(x) = -1$ trivially satisfy this, plus the zero function, those are likely the only solutions without additional constraints.\n\n### Conclusion and Solution:\nThus, summarizing the solutions:\n- $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- $f(x) = -1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor $f(2017)$ specifically:\n\\[ f(2017) \\in \\{ 0, 1, -1 \\}. \\]\n\nThus, the final answer in a box is:\n\\[\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\]", "round 1": "Examining the problem and comparing the provided solutions, let's reiterate and confirm the logic through critical analysis.\n\nGiven that the function $f: \\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$ for **all** $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we analyze the implications step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Substitute $y = 0$\n\nBy setting $y=0$ in the functional equation:\n\\[ f(x)f(0) = f(x-0) = f(x). \\]\n\nHere, either:\n- **Case 1**: $f(0) \\neq 0$, whereby dividing both sides by $f(0)$ reveals $f(x) = 1$, since $f(0)$ must be $1$ to satisfy $f(x) = f(x)$.\n- **Case 2**: $f(0) = 0$, leading directly to $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ because $f(x)f(0) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute $x = y$\n\nSetting $x=y$ gives:\n\\[ f(x)f(x) = f(0). \\]\nFrom previous analysis, we determined $f(0)$ is either $0$ or $1$.\n\n- If $f(0) = 1$, then $f(x)^2 = 1$ for all $x$, suggesting $f(x) = 1$ or $f(x) = -1$ depending entirely on $x$.\n- If $f(0) = 0$, already deduced that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Step 3: Examination of Derived Solutions\n\nThe distinct possibilities considered are:\n- $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\n- $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$.\n- $f(x) = -1$ for all $x$.\n\n**Validation**: All three meet the original functional equation:\n- $0\\cdot0 = 0$, $(\\pm 1)(\\pm 1) = 1$, and both are consistent with potential outputs (either $0$ or $1$ based on $f(0)$'s value).\n\n### Conclusion: Identification of Possible Values for $f(2017)$ \n\nSince $f(2017)$ must adhere to whatever function form $f(x)$ takes for all $x$:\n- **If $f(x) = 0**: $f(2017) = 0$.\n- **If $f(x) = 1**: $f(2017) = 1$.\n- **If $f(x) = -1**: $f(2017) = -1$.\n\nEach case is valid, so the potential values for $f(2017)$ are $0$, $1$, and $-1$.\n\n### Answer\n\nGiven the conclusion of the potential values for $f(2017)$ derived from fundamentally applying the given functional equation to edge cases and general $x$, we summarize:\n\\[ \\boxed{0, 1, -1} \\]", "round 2": "Given the functional equation \\( f(x)f(y) = f(x-y) \\) for a function \\( f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\), we execute a thorough analysis to explore all possible solutions and hence determine values for \\( f(2017) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\( f(0) \\)\n\nSetting \\( y = 0 \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ f(x)f(0) = f(x) \\]\n\nThere are two cases:\n- **Case A**: If \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\), we divide by \\( f(0) \\), leading to \\( f(x) = 1 \\) (since the only multiplicative identity in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is 1).\n- **Case B**: If \\( f(0) = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) = 0 \\cdot f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze \\( f(x) = 0 \\) Scenario\n\nFrom Case B, we already deduced:\n- \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\). \n- Substituting into the equation, \\( 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\), which is consistent with \\( f(x-y) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider Non-Zero Constant Solutions\n\nFrom Case A, assuming \\( f(x) = 1 \\):\n- \\( f(x)f(y) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\), which matches \\( f(x-y) = 1 \\).\n\nSetting \\( x = y \\):\n- \\( f(x)f(x) = f(0) \\), and since \\( f(0) = 1 \\), then \\( f(x)^2 = 1 \\).

We get:\n  \\[\n  f(x)f(0) = f(x)\n  \\]\n  Assuming \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( f(0) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) = f(x) \\cdot 1 \n  \\]\n  which is trivially true. Hence, if \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\), this equation does not give us additional information. \n\n- Next, let \\( x = y \\). The function equation simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  f(x)f(x) = f(0)\n  \\]\n  This tells us that \\( f(x)^2 = f(0) \\), suggesting \\( f(x) \\) could be a constant function if it is non-zero everywhere.\n\n**2.

However, a crucial realization is that without further constraints or additional conditions of the function (like continuity, differentiability), it's difficult to dismiss the potential of \\( f \\) oscillating between 1 and -1.\n\n### Updated Conclusion:\n   - If \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is a solution, \\( f(2017) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f \\) is constant with \\( f(x) = 1 \\) everywhere, \\( f(2017) = 1 \\).\n   - If \\( f \\) is constant with \\( f(x) = -1 \\) everywhere, \\( f(2017) = -1 \\).\n\n### Potential Error in Original Response Check:\n   - When examining the non-constant cases, careful consideration shows that \\( f(x) \\) being non-zero doesn't necessarily force \\( f(x) \\) to alternate strictly as \\( \\pm 1 \\) without specific extra conditions.
