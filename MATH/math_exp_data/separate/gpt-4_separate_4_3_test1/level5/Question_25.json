Let\u2019s denote the coordinates of these points as follows:\nA = (a, a^2) and C = (-a, a^2).\n\nWhy a parabola is symmetric about the y-axis.\nSo if A and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, their x-coordinates are opposites of each other, which leads us to selecting a and -a. \n\nRound 2: \n\nNext, it's given that OABC is a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides have the same length. Thus, the length of the segment AC is equal to the length of OB. \n\nThe length of AC is the difference between the y-coordinates of A and C, given that they lie at the same x-coordinate. Thus, the length of AC = C_y - A_y = a^2 - (-a^2) = 2a^2, by considering the coordinates of A and C.  \n\nRound 3:\n\nNow, we need to find the point B, such that OB = AC. The y-coordinate B_y of the point B equals the length of the segment AC, i.e., B= (b, 2a^2) for some b.\n\nRound 4:\n\nFinally, we\u2019re asked to find the equation of the parabola that B lies on. Since B depends on a, the equation for this parabola in the form \"y = px^2 + qx + r\", should not contain a. \n\nWe know the coordinates of point B can be written as (b, 2a^2), and we know from the properties of a rectangle and our choice of a, that a^2 = b^2, as OAB is a right triangle. Let's substitute this into the coordinates of B, yielding B = (b, 2b^2).\n\nRound 5:\n\nWe\u2019ve transformed the system and written everything in terms of b rather than a. Our coordinate for point B is now independent of point A and expressed in terms of a single variable. Thus, we see that the fixed parabola that B lies on is described by the equation y = 2x^2. \n\nTherefore, p = 2, q = 0, and r = 0.

A better approach would've been to equate the lengths of $AC$ and $OB$. Since $AC = 2a^2$, the y-coordinate of vertex $B$ should be equal to this length. Therefore, vertex $B$ should be denoted as $(b, 2a^2)$.\n\nRe-examining the coordinates of the point $B = (b, 2a^2)$, we seek to express the y-coordinate (the length $AC = OB$) in terms of the x-coordinate of $B$.\n\nFrom our configuration $A=-B$, that is $b=-a$, it follows that $AC = OB$, so we can rewrite the coordinates of $B$ in terms of x-coordinate $(b := x)$, yielding $B=(x, 2x^2)$.  \n\nHence, the equation of the parabola that point $B$ lies on is given by $y = 2x^2$.

This means that $OA = OC$ and $OB = AC$.\n\n3. The length of $AC$ is the difference between the y-coordinates of $A$ and $C$. Since both lie on same y-coordinate, the height of $AC$ is $2a^2$.\n\n3. In a rectangle, diagonals are of equal length. Hence, the length of $OB$ will also be equal to $2a^2$.\n\n4. The x-coordinate of $B$ (denoted as $b$) is necessarily the same as the x-coordinate of $C$ (denoted as $a$) because OC is parallel to AB, and OB is the diagonal of the rectangle.

It's also important to note that rectangles maintain equal opposite sides and right angles at their vertices.\n\nRound 3:\nFrom round 2, as B shares the same y-coordinate (a^2) with A and C, the x-coordinate at B could be derived from the horizontal distance AB or CB. In this rectangle, AB equals OC (since rectangles have equal opposite sides), hence the x-coordinate at B equals to twice the x-coordinate at A which is 2a. This gives us the vertex B (2a, a^2).\n\nRound 4:\nNow, we substitute B (2a, a^2) into the parabola equation in the form y = px^2 + qx + r and we get a^2 = p(4a^2) + 2aq + r. We can see right away that p=1/4 since the coefficient for a^2 on both sides must be equal.

As we have a single point and there is no x intercept, r = 0. \n\nFinal Round (Solution):\nAfter finding the values of p, q and r from the above steps, we can substitute these values into the equation form y = px^2 + qx + r to get our resultant parabola equation:\n\\boxed{y = \\frac{1}{4}x^2}", "round 1": "Examining each solution provided, the approaches seem quite variable and offer various points of view on the question.

Therefore, solutions that presuppose B's x-coordinate to be 2a, or present the parabola as y=2x^2 or y=4x^2, don't align with the geometry of the problem.\n\nIf we visualize the problem, we can acknowledge that B lies on or between the parabolic branches of y=x^2 as they open upwards and downwards. Since the rectangle is symmetric over the y-axis, the rectangle's height is 2a, which is the distance between A and C on the parabola y=x^2. Therefore, the y-coordinate of B, or the displacement along y-axis from O to B, is a. \n\nSubstituting this into the equation of the parabola gives us a = px^2 + qx + r. As there is no horizontal displacement, q and r would equate to 0, leaving us with the parabola equation, a = px^2, where a is constant, as the area of rectangle isn't changing. As a result, to find p, we can equate the above equation to y=x^2 (which is the given parabola that A and C lie on), hence confirming that p=1.\n\nI now come to the conclusion that the equation of the parabola B lies on is \\boxed{y=x^2}.", "round 2": "Given all the solutions presented by other agents, it seems we need to find a consensus on the equation of the parabola that vertex $B$ lies on. \n\nThe points $A$ and $C$ on the parabola $y=x^2$ can be given by $(-a, a^2)$ and $(a, a^2)$, respectively. Given that these points form the ends of a rectangle with origin $O$, it follows that $OA = OC = OB$ because in a rectangle diagonals are equal.

Since \u2220OAB is a right angle, the slope of OA * the slope of AB = -1 (because the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -1).\nSo, the slope of OA, which is x\u2081\u00b2 / x\u2081 = x\u2081, times the slope of AB,  which is 2 * x\u2081, or 2x\u2081 is equal to -1.\nThat implies x\u2081\u00b2 = -1/2.\n\nSimilarly considering triangle OCB gives x\u2082\u00b2 = 1/2. Hence, x\u2081\u00b2 < x\u2082\u00b2\n\nSo if the x-coordinate of B is x (i.e., B is (x, y)), it must be that x\u2081\u00b2 < x\u00b2 < x\u2082\u00b2, or -1/2 < x\u00b2 < 1/2. The y-coordinate of B (or, the altitude of the rectangle) is (x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, because the y-coordinate of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082)  is (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2.
