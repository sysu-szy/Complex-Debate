{"question": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$.

Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began.

Her new win ratio is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w + 3}{t + 4}\n\\]\n\nThe problem specifies that this ratio is greater than $0.503$. Setting up this inequality, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{w + 3}{t + 4} > 0.503\n\\]\n\nSince we know that $w = 0.5t$, we substitute $w$ in the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5t + 3}{t + 4} > 0.503\n\\]\n\nTo clear the decimal, let's multiply everything by 1000 (converting to an integer comparison to avoid floating point inaccuracies):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{500t + 3000}{t + 4} > 503\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(t + 4)$ to eliminate the fraction, assuming $t \\neq -4$ (which wouldn't make sense in the context), we get:\n\n\\[\n500t + 3000 > 503t + 2012\n\\]\n\nSolving for $t$:\n\n\\[\n3000 - 2012 > 503t - 500t\n\\]\n\n\\[\n988 > 3t\n\\]\n\n\\[\nt < \\frac{988}{3} \\approx 329.33\n\\]\n\nSince the number of total matches $t$ must be an integer, we round down:\n\n\\[\nt = 329\n\\]\n\nThe largest number $t$ can be is 329.
