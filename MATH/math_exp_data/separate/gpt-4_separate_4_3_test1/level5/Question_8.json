{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.

So the sum of all $b_i$ where $0 \\leq b_i \\leq a_i$ is $\\frac{a_i(a_i + 1)}{2}$.

Solving this equation would yield  $a_i = 0$, 12, or -13. \n\nSince $n > 1$, there must be at least one prime factor, ruling out the possibility of $a_i = 0$ for all $i$. Similarly, because n is positive, we don't consider the negative result, ruling out $a_i = -13$. That leaves us with $a_i = 12$, for all $i$.\n\nTherefore, to minimize $n$, we should choose k as the lowest possible value, $k=1$, and the smallest prime number $p_1 = 2$.

Assuming $n$ has a prime factorization of $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, the divisors can be expressed as $p_1^{b_1}p_2^{b_2}\\cdots p_k^{b_k}$, where $0 \\leq b_i \\leq a_i$, $i = 1, 2, \\cdots, k$. \n\nWhen we examine the product of the divisors of $n$, we calculate the product of these divisors over all possible values of $b_i$.

Think about what the prime factorization of $n^6$ looks like: $n^6 = p_1^{6a_1} * p_2^{6a_2} * ...$ \n\nThis suggests that all of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n^6$ are multiples of 6. These exponents are not necessarily even, for example, they could be 6, 12, 18, etc. \n\nHowever, the exponents in the prime factorization of the product of all positive divisors of $n$ are multiples of $a_1,a_2,...$; therefore, for the product of the prime factors to be a perfect square, all exponents must also be even, which is not necessarily the case for the exponents derived from $n^6$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer whose divisors have a product of its sixth power (n>1) must be an integer whose prime factorization includes only primes raised to the power of 1.

Prime Factorization: The prime factorization of a number will help us determine the divisors of the number. For this problem, let's denote the prime factorization of $n=p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_k$ are prime numbers and $a_i$ are respective positive integers.\n\n2. Positive Divisors: For a given prime factorization, the exponent of each prime can range from 0 to the respective $a_i$. Including all possible combinations will give us the list of all positive divisors for $n$.\n\n3. Products of Divisors: Let's consider all such divisors and their product.

Comparing the Product of Divisors to $n^6$: The original problem states that this product must be equal to $n^6$, so we can equate this to the prime factorization for $n^6$. \n\n5. Simplifying and Solving: If we equate the two prime factorizations, we will get $12a_i = a_i(a_i + 1)$ for all $i=1,2,...,k$. Solving this equation tells us that $a_i = 0$, 12, or -13.\n\nThe possible values of the exponent $a_i$ allow us to quickly narrow down the options for $n$. First, $n > 1$, which means there must be at least one prime factor ($a_i \u2260 0$ for all $i$). Second, $n$ is a positive integer, so $a_i \u2260 -13$. This leaves us with $a_i = 12$ for all $i$.\n\n6. Minimizing: To find the smallest potential $n$ we minimize the number of prime factors to k=1 and choose the smallest prime $p_1=2$.

Let's say $n$ has exactly $k$ distinct positive divisors, which we will call $d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$, where $d_1 = 1$ and $d_k = n$. Note that these divisors can be paired off into $k/2$ pairs, where the product of each pair equals to $n$ (since every divisor $d_i$ less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$ can be paired with a divisor $d_j$ greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{n}$ such that $d_id_j = n$). \n\nKnowing this property, we can write the product of all divisors as the product of those pairs, which simplifies to $n^{k/2}$. But this product is given to be equal to $n^6$, so we have the equation $n^{k/2} = n^6$. Now, by equalizing the exponents, we find $k/2 = 6$ or $k = 12$. \n\nThis tells us that $n$ must have exactly 12 divisors.
