What is the sum of all of the possible distinct sums?", "answer": "Any sum formed by a combination of the numbers $2,4$ and $8$ must be divisible by $2$. The smallest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, and the largest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. After testing, we find that \\begin{align*}6 = 2+2+2,\\ 8 = 4+2+2,\\ 10 = 4+4+2, \\\\ 12 = 4+4+4,\\ 14 = 8+4+2,\\ 16 = 8+4+4, \\\\ 18 = 8+8+2,\\ 20 = 8+8+4,\\ 24 = 8+8+8.\\end{align*} However, we cannot find a combination that will add to be $22$: if two of the numbers are not $8$, then the maximum possible sum is $4 + 4 + 8 = 16$. Thus, two of the numbers picked must be $8$, but then the third ball must have the number $6$, which is not possible. Thus, the answer is the sum of the even numbers from $6$ to $24$ excluding $22$, which is $\\boxed{128}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "First of all, since there are $3$ balls and the selection procedure is repeated $3$ times, there are $3^3 = 27$ total distinct outcomes.\n\nEach selection is independent, so the value we obtain each time can be considered as an independent random variable. If we let $X$ denotes the value we get in each selection, then the value we obtain after summing up three times is $3X$. \n\nThe expected value of $X$ is given by the average of the values $2, 4,$ and $8$, so we have $E(X) = \\frac{2 + 4 + 8}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected value of $3X$, which is basically the sum of all possible distinct sums.

She utilizes a symmetry argument, arguing that for every way to achieve a sum of $k$, there's a corresponding way to achieve a sum of $30-k$.
