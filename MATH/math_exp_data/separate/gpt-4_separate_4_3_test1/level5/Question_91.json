However, here our right triangle uses the radii (each 14 inches), not the diameter; hence, the hypotenuse (diameter of full circle across points A and B) will be 28 inches since twice the radius equals the diameter.\n\nNow focusing on the semicircles: As the problem text states, \"The two smaller regions are tangent semicircles,\" it implies these semicircles fit alongside each other inside segment AB (the hypotenuse of triangle AQB).\n\nLet's denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as r. Since there are two semicircles sitting along AB (being tangent), and together they need to equal the total length of AB, their combined diameters (which are twice their radii) should equal the length of AB. Therefore, if we denote r as the radius of each smaller semicircle, then the sum of the diameters of the two semicircles is \\(2r + 2r = 4r\\).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the length of AB (the hypotenuse in triangle AQB and thus the effective total \"diameter space\" in which semicircles fit) is 28 inches.

This implies that triangle $AQB$ is a right triangle (by the property that an angle subtended by a diameter on the circumference of a circle is a right angle).\n\n2. **Identify properties:** Since $AQ = BQ = 14$ inches (radii of circle $Q$), $AQB$ is, in fact, a right isosceles triangle because both the legs of this right triangle are equal.\n\n3. **Placing the semicircles:** The smaller regions which are formed by tangent semicircles have a different radius, say $r$ each. Each semicircle is tangent to the other and each tangent to $AQ$ and $BQ$ respectively.\n\n4. **Area and Pythagorean Theorem Application:** The key to finding $r$ is by using the area relations and the Pythagorean Theorem.

We need to find the radius of the smaller semicircle tangent inside this quarter-circle.\n\n### Breakdown of Solution:\n1. **Understanding the Setup**: The quarter-circle \\( AQB \\) is formed by the right angle at \\( Q \\). Any semicircle inside this quarter-circle tangent to both \\( AQ \\) and \\( BQ \\) will also have its diameter \\( 2r \\) lying along the line \\( AB \\), which spans the right angle from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Angle \\( AQB \\) as 90 degrees**: This setup implies that the straight line distance \\( AB \\), across the diameter of the larger circle, is \\( 28 \\) inches because twice the radius is \\( 2 \\times 14 \\).\n\n3. **Semicircle Tangency Configuration**: Since the semicircles are tangent to \\( AQ \\) and \\( BQ \\) and to each other, they symmetrically occupy the space within the quarter-circle. The semicircle's diameter is half of \\( AB \\).\n\n4. **Radius Calculation**:\n   - The line segment \\( AB \\) acting as the quarter-circle's diameter at \\( 28 \\) inches means if the semicircles are inside the quarter-circle in a symmetrical configuration, each semi-circle's full span (diameter) effectively forms half of \\( AB \\), considering tangential touch at the midpoint of \\( AB \\).\n   - Diameter of each semicircle is half of \\( AB \\): \\( \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\) inches.\n   - Radius of the semicircle is half of its diameter: \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) inches.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe radius of each smaller semicircle tangential to both \\( AQ \\) and \\( BQ \\) inside the quarter-circle and touching each other symmetrically is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) inches. This corrects and clarifies any confusion about the tangency and symmetry in the configuration of these semicircles within the given quarter-circle.", "round 2": "Let's re-evaluate the given problem to provide an accurate and simplified solution. To address the intricacies of the problem, we will confirm the configuration of the semicircles and their tangency within the given geometrical setup.\n\n### Geometry of the Setup:\n- We know that circle $Q$ has a radius of 14 inches.\n- The radii $AQ$ and $BQ$ are perpendicular, therefore, triangle $AQB$ is a right triangle with both legs ($AQ$ and $BQ$) equal to 14 inches, since they are radii of the circle.\n\n### Hypotenuse Calculation:\nSince $\\triangle AQB$ is a right triangle and both legs are 14 inches:\n\\[ AB = \\sqrt{AQ^2 + BQ^2} = \\sqrt{14^2 + 14^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 196} = \\sqrt{392} = 14\\sqrt{2} \\text{ inches (length of diameter)}. \\]\n\n### Tangent Semicircles Configuration:\n- It is stated that the two smaller semicircles are tangent to each other and to $AQ$ and $BQ$. Each semicircle's diameter will lie along $AB$, spanning from $A$ to $B$.\n\n### Semicircle Diameter and Radius Calculation:\nAssuming there are two semicircles inside the quarter-circle formed between $AQ$ and $BQ$, their combined diameters must span $AB$, which we calculated as $14\\sqrt{2}$. Each semicircle having half of $AB$ gives:\n\\[ \\text{Diameter of each semicircle} = \\frac{14\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 7\\sqrt{2} \\text{ inches.} \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of each semicircle, which is half of the diameter, is:\n\\[ r = \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\text{ inches.} \\]\n\n### Simplification:\nSince this is an exact calculation using precise square roots and halving, no further simplifications can reduce the complexity of the final answer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe radius of each smaller semicircle, tangent to both $AQ$ and $BQ$, perfectly positioned within the quarter-circle beside each other, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}} \\text{ inches.} \\]\n\nThis solution aligns with proper geometric calculations and assumptions, complemented by the correct interpretation of tangency and symmetry within the structural confines of the given circle and perpendicular radii."}]}
