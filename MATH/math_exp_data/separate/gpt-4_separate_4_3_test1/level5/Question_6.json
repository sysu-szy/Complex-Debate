Also, I have been given the values of $f$ at two points, $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15$. \n\nI noticed that the difference between the inputs 15 and 20 is the same as the difference between their outputs 20 and 15, both are 5 units apart. This might be a significant observation that could help to simplify the problem or make some other useful deductions.\n\nRound 2: Recurrence Relation to Difference Equation\n\nUsing the functional equation, I can start from $x = 20$ and use the relation backward to reach $x = 15$. However, I was curious to see what happens if we subtract $f(x-1)$ from both sides of the equation to give a different equation that might present some insights.\n\nThe resulting equation is $f(x) - f(x-1) = f(x + 1) - f(x)$.\n\nThis equation is interesting because it shows that the differences between consecutive function values, $f(x)$ and $f(x + 1)$ or $f(x)$ and $f(x - 1)$, are the same. This would imply that $f(x)$ increases or decreases at a constant rate.\n\nRound 3: Using Given Values in Difference Equation\n\nI can use this difference equation with the given values to analyze the function further.\n\nLet's input $x = 15$. We have $f(15) - f(14) = f(16) - f(15)$\n\nSince $f(15) = 20$ as provided, we have $20 - f(14) = f(16) - 20$\n\nNow, let's input $x = 20$, We have $f(20) - f(19) = f(21) - f(20)$\n\nSince $f(20) = 15$ as provided, we get $15 - f(19) = f(21) - 15$\n\nBy considering these two equations, we realize that $20 - f(14) = 15 - f(19)$ or $f(19) - f(14) = 5$, which matches our initial observation that the difference between $f(x)$ values that are 5 units apart is 5.\n\nRound 4: Generalizing the Pattern and Getting the Result\n\nThe conclusion from the previous round suggests a pattern: if $x$ and $y$ differ by 5 units, then $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ also differ by 5 units. \nSo, we can deduce that $f(20152015)$ and $f(20152010)$ differ by 5 units.

The first viewpoint proposes that the function $f(x)$ behaves like $f(x) = 35 - x$, yielding the result $f(20152015) = 30$. The second viewpoint suggests a pattern based on divisibility by 5 with the outcome $f(20152015) = 20$. The third viewpoint suggests that the function $f(x)$ alternates between 15 and -15 depending on the parity of the input, resulting in $f(20152015) = -15$. \n\nLooking at these different approaches, I need to re-evaluate my solution which yielded $f(20152015) = 4030414$.\n\nMy original approach made use of the functional equation to derive a difference equation and deduced a pattern when input values differ by 5. My conclusion was that the function increases or decreases at a constant rate when the difference between input values is 5. However, I made an assumption that the rate of increase or decrease is 1 which might have been flawed. \n\nGiven that my derivation seems to be in conflict with the conclusions of the other agents, I realize that I may have misunderstood the behavior of the function. \n\nAfter contemplating the varied solutions, it seems evident that the piece of information that my initial approach didn't take into consideration is the symmetry that appears in the given function values, $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15$. Both agent solution0 and solution1 highlight this trait and base their reasoning around it. \n\nAgent solution0 posits the function to have the form $f(x) = 35 - x$. Substituting the values $x = 15$ and $x = 20$, we see that this conjecture satisfies the given conditions.

This pattern also satisfies the given conditions and the recurrence relation while shedding light on the behavior of the function for multiples of 5.\n\nBetween these two interpretations, the former conjecture seems more plausible as it describes a linear function, which aligns more naturally with the constant differences that my original difference equation suggested. Thus, for this problem, I will side with agent solution0.\n\nFollowing this conception, we find that $f(20152015) = 35 - 20152015 = -20151980$, which is positive under modulo 35 operation.

By re-examining the functional equation with these values in mind, it can be observed that a recurrent pattern emerges when comparing the function values for numbers whose difference is a multiple of 5. \n\nDeveloping on this observation, the conjecture made by Agent solution 0 seems to provide a coherent explanation. The proposal suggests the function to have the form $f(x) = 35 - x$. Upon substituting $x = 15$ and $x = 20$ into this function, it can be verified to satisfy the given conditions. Checking its validity with the given functional equation also confirms it to hold the functional relationship as required. \n\nTherefore, adopting this renewed understanding of $f(x)$, to compute the function value at $x = 20152015$, $f(20152015)$ should be evaluated as $35 - 20152015$. This gives an initial outcome of $f(20152015) = -20151980$. Recognizing that the question requires the answer to be modulo 35, the remainder of $-20151980$ upon division by 35 should be computed.
