The sum of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is 15.\n2. Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( x \\): the smaller number.\n- \\( y \\): the larger number.\n\n### Equations\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n2. \\( 4x = 2y - 60 \\)\n\n### Solve equations\nFirst, rearrange and solve Equation 2 for \\( y \\):\n\\[ 2y = 4x + 60 \\]\n\\[ y = 2x + 30 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y \\) from the rearrangement into Equation 1 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x + 2x + 30 = 15 \\]\n\\[ 3x + 30 = 15 \\]\n\\[ 3x = -15 \\]\n\\[ x = -5 \\]\n\nUsing \\( x = -5 \\), compute \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = 2(-5) + 30 \\]\n\\[ y = -10 + 30 \\]\n\\[ y = 20 \\]\n\n### Verification\nNow, verify if these values satisfy the given equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n   \\[ -5 + 20 = 15 \\]\n   Correct.\n   \n2. \\( 4x = 2y - 60 \\)\n   \\[ 4(-5) = 2(20) - 60 \\]\n   \\[ -20 = 40 - 60 \\]\n   \\[ -20 = -20 \\]\n   Also correct.\n\nThese values satisfy all the given conditions. Even though \\( x = -5 \\) is negative, it is mathematically valid and does not violate any explicit constraints about negativity given in the problem statement. Since the problem did not specify non-negative values, the solution is correct with the given constraints.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the larger number \\( y \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\nThis answer adheres to all problem constraints and the algebraic manipulations were checked thoroughly for accuracy."}]}
