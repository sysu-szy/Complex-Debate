Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the Coordinates:**\n   - **\\(D\\):** This is clearly defined in the problem as moving 4 units up from \\(C\\), which already moved 4 units to the right from \\(A\\)(0,0). So, \\(D\\) is at \\((4, 8)\\).\n   - **\\(E\\):** From \\(D\\), \\(E\\) is at the end of a diagonal of a square whose both sides are 4. As the diagonal splits the square's right-angle into two 45-degree angles, \\(E\\) moves \\(4\\) units diagonally in a 45-degree angle left downward. In terms of coordinate change, each unit movement at a 45-degree angle changes both x and y coordinates by \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\), yielding coordinates \\((4 - 2\\sqrt{2}, 8 - 2\\sqrt{2})\\).\n   - **\\(F\\):** Similar to \\(E\\) but from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is \\(4\\) units diagonally right upward. Thus, \\(F\\) reconverges back to the horizontal alignment with \\(D\\), at \\((4, 8)\\). Therefore \\(F\\) returns to the coordinates \\((4 + 4\\sqrt{2}, 8)\\).\n\n2. **Understanding \\(DF\\) and \\(EM\\):**\n   - The line \\(DF\\) is horizontal because the y-coordinate for both \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) is 8.\n   - \\(EM\\) is perpendicular to \\(DF\\), implying \\(EM\\) is a vertical line from \\(E\\) down to \\(DF\\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(EM\\):**\n   - As \\(DF\\) is horizontal (y = 8) and goes through \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), the vertical coordinate for \\(E\\) is \\(8 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, the length of \\(EM\\) is the difference in y-coordinates between \\(E\\) and any point on \\(DF\\).\n   - \\(EM = |y_E - 8| = |(8 - 2\\sqrt{2}) - 8| = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(x^2\\):**\n   - \\(x^2 = (EM)^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(x^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).

Here are the steps in detail:\n\n1. **Understanding the diagram**: The shape involves multiple right angles, with lines $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EF$, $FG$, $GH$, and $HK$, each having length $4$ units. However, angles at $D$ and $F$ are not right angles; they connect segments forming angles of diagonal lines.\n\n2. **Recognizing $DF$ as a diagonal**: Given that $D$ to $E$ and $E$ to $F$ forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with vertical and horizontal components of $4$ units each (not right at $D$ and $F$, these transitions mean $DE$ and $EF$ are diagonals across squares formed by four-unit sides. The length of each, by the Pythagorean theorem, is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3. **Point $E$ in a symmetrical position and slope analysis**: From the description, $DF$ appears as a straight line with both $D$ and $F$ presumably lying vertically over each other with $E$ lying on that line too. So $D$, $E$, and $F$ make line $DF$ a whole line segment of $2 \\times 4\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n4. **Location of $M$**: Given that $EM$ is perpendicular to $DF$, the point $M$ is where the perpendicular line from $E$ to $DF$ intersects $DF$. Given the symmetry present, and the location of $E$, $M$ would naturally coincide with the middle of segment $DF$, which makes $DM = MF = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n5. **Calculating $EM$**: With $D$, $E$, and $F$ positioned such that $DF$ is horizontal, $E$ is below the midpoint of $DF$. Triangle $DEM$ is a right triangle, where $EM$ is opposite to the 45-degree angle formed at $E$ by the diagonals $DE$ and $EF$. Since triangle $DEM$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, both legs have equal length.\n\n   Because $D$ and $E$ are like the hypotenuse of half the diagonal square, the triangle $DEM$ can be visualized as part of a square with $DE$ being the diagonal.
