Hypotenuse of the 45-45-90 Triangle (labeled as \\(x\\)):**\n   - Given that each leg of the 45-45-90 triangle is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), the hypotenuse \\(x\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the leg:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion and Correct Answer:**\n- The value of \\(x\\), which is the hypotenuse of the 45-45-90 triangle formed within the diagram, is indeed \\(\\sqrt{6}\\). Thus, the final simplified answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]\nThis solution consolidates the geometric properties of the involved special right triangles effectively, with a clear understanding of their relationship given the original diagram and the defined conditions.", "round 2": "Let's revisit the problem with the details and structure provided, ensuring clarity and the correct application of the properties of special right triangles. Here, we need to find the value of \\(x\\) in a diagram involving a 45-45-90 triangle and a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### **Identifying Triangle Types and Properties:**\n1. **30-60-90 Triangle**:\n   - Hypotenuse is given as 2 (since it is opposite the \\(90^\\circ\\) angle and adjacent to \\(60^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\) angles).\n   - Ratio of sides: \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\). This means:\n     - **Shortest side** (opposite \\(30^\\circ\\)): \\(\\frac{2}{2} = 1\\)\n     - **Medium side** (opposite \\(60^\\circ\\)): \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times 1 = \\sqrt{3}\\)\n\n2. **45-45-90 Triangle**:\n   - It shares the side opposite the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle of the 30-60-90 triangle as one of its legs.\n   - This side is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - Properties: Legs are equal, and hypotenuse is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times a leg.\n\n### **Determine the Value of \\(x\\)**\n- Since both legs of the 45-45-90 triangle are equal and the length of one leg established from the adjacent 30-60-90 triangle is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), both legs of the 45-45-90 triangle are \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- Hypotenuse \\(x\\) (which we need to find) is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the leg length:\n  \\[\n  x = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{6}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the interrelationship between the triangles and applying the side ratios properly for 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles, we find that \\(x = \\sqrt{6}\\). All steps are validated correctly under the interpretation of special right triangle properties and the information available in the prompt.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]\nThis succinctly and accurately solves for \\(x\\) based on the geometric relationships and properties of the triangles in the diagram."}]}
