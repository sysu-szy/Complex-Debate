When $\\frac{1}{2} < x \\leq 1$, $f(x) = 2 - 2x$ which maps the interval $(\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ onto $[0,1]$ again, but in reverse order.\n\nTherefore, each application of $f(x)$ either doubles $x$ within the range, or mirrors and then rescales it within the interval $[0,1]$ based on the value of $x$. \n\n### Iterative Properties of $f(x)$\n\nApplying $f^{[2]}(x) = f(f(x))$, we notice that due to the operations of $f(x)$, the resulting $f^{[2]}(x)$ operation leaves the interval $[0,1]$ comprised of four segments, each mapped twice onto $[0,1]$. \n\nEach subsequent application of $f$ essentially doubles the number of segments by splitting each existing segment in two, mapping them onto $[0,1]$. Thus after $k$ applications, $2^k$ segments exist.\n\n### Determining $f^{[2005]}(x)$\n\nThe critical observation is that the structure of $f(x)$ means each iteration of $f$ doubles the number of intervals and each segment either contains or does not contain the point $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nGiven that each application of $f$ maps segments back into $[0,1]$, the precise location of these segments depends on prior segmentations. The number of segments touching the point $\\frac{1}{2}$ evolves predictably through each iteration.\n\nAfter $n$ iterations, $2^n$ segments cover the range $[0,1]$. Thus, $f^{[2005]}(x)$ creates $2^{2005}$ segments.\n\n### Finding $x$ where $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$\n\nSince each segment originates from $[0,1]$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ keeps being a splitting point in each iteration, each of the $2^{2005}$ segments would have exactly one occurrence of $x$ such that $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of values of $x$ for which $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$ is $2^{2005}$.\n\nIn the problem's notation, $p=2$ and $a=2005$, hence $p+a=2+2005$.\n\n\\[\\boxed{2007}\\]\n\nThis is confirmed by our understanding of the function's iterative behavior and the nature of the doubling and splitting process inherent in each application of $f(x)$.", "round 1": "Given the function \\( f(x) \\) defined piecewise on the interval \\([0,1]\\), we need to analyze the impact of iterating \\( f \\) 2005 times (denoted as \\( f^{[2005]}(x) \\)) and identify the count of values \\( x \\) for which \\( f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\). \n\n**Step 1: Understanding \\( f(x) \\)**\n- For \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1}{2}, f(x) = 2x \\).\n- For \\( \\frac{1}{2} < x \\leq 1, f(x) = 2 - 2x \\).\n\nThis structure ensures that \\( f \\) maps the entire interval \\([0,1]\\) back onto itself while reflecting sections around \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Step 2: Iterations of \\( f(x) \\)**\n- Knowing how \\( f \\) modifies \\( x \\) depending on the range simplifies the understanding of subsequent iterations.\n- \\( f \\) doubles \\( x \\), or shifts and inverts it, alternately focusing or refocusing around the midpoint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  \nThis leads to doubling the number of segments in each interval per iteration, making the number of these segments \\( 2^n \\) at the \\( n \\)-th iteration. \n\n**Step 3: Calculating \\( f^{[2005]}(x) \\)**\n- Since each iteration splits the intervals further while retaining proportional mapping over the original interval, by the 2005-th iteration, the interval is divided into \\( 2^{2005} \\) parts.\n  \n**Step 4: Condition \\( f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\)**\n- At each iteration, a \\( x \\) that results in \\( f^{[n]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\) splits the current segment into two further segments in the next iteration. \n- Considering \\( f \\) operations, each segment results in two further sub-segments determining whether it remains unchanged or flipped in the next iteration. \n\nAt the \\( 2005 \\)-th iteration, the number of intervals where \\( f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\) matches exactly the number of parts the interval is split into, which is \\( 2^{2005} \\).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n- The solution is \\( p^a = 2^{2005} \\).\n- \\( p = 2 \\) (the base of the exponential representation) and \\( a = 2005 \\) (the exponent in the representation).\n\nAdding these values gives \\( p + a = 2 + 2005 = 2007 \\).\n\nHence, the number of values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is expressed as \\( 2^{2005} \\), and the solution to the problem is \\(\\boxed{2007}\\).", "round 2": "To find the number of values \\(x\\) in \\([0,1]\\) for which \\(f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we'll follow these steps, closely examining the behavior of the iterated function and simplifying the mathematical logic behind it.\n\n### Key Properties of \\(f\\)\n1. **Function Definition**: \\(f(x) = 2x\\) for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(f(x) = 2-2x\\) for \\(\\frac{1}{2} < x \\leq 1\\).\n\n### Behavior Under Iteration\n2. **On Iteration**: Each section \\([0, \\frac{1}{2}]\\) and \\([\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\) upon applying \\(f\\) becomes newly segmented into two parts: \n   - In \\([0, \\frac{1}{2}]\\), points start at 0 and reach up to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or revert by \\(f\\) to \\([\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\).\n   - In \\([\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\), points transform back into \\([0, \\frac{1}{2}]\\) and \\([\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\).\n   \n### Nature of \\(f^{[2005]}(x)\\)\n3. **Doubling of Segments**: With each iteration, the segment count doubles, hence in the \\(n\\)-th iteration, there are \\(2^n\\) segments.
