{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.

We recall a significant property of numbers that the product of all divisors of any positive integer $n$ is $n^{k/2}$ where $k$ is the number of divisors of $n$.\n\nGiven that the product of divisors of $n$ is $n^6$, our equation becomes:\n\\[ n^{k/2} = n^6 \\]\nFrom this, we find that $k/2 = 6$ or $k = 12$. So, the number $n$ must have exactly 12 divisors.\n\nNext, we examine the possibilities for $n$ to have exactly 12 divisors. The number of divisors function, denoted $d(n)$, equals $12$ for a few typical forms of $n$:\n1. $n = p^{11}$ for some prime $p$.\n2. $n = p_1p_2^5$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n3. $n = p_1^2p_2^2p_3$ for distinct primes $p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n4. $n = p_1^3 p_2^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nWe seek the smallest $n$; thus, we ought to consider the smallest primes. Let's compute $n$ for each case:\n1. Using the smallest prime, $2^{11} = 2048$, this gives a high value and is likely not minimal.\n2. With $p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3$, $n = 2 \\times 3^5 = 2 \\times 243 = 486$; still quite large.\n3. With $p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5$, $n = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180$; getting smaller.\n4. With $p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3$, $n = 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72$; this is smaller still.\n\nWe need to verify that $72$ meets the condition of the product of its divisors being $72^6$. First, we calculate the product of divisors ($d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_{12}$) of $72$:\nThe divisors of $72$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72$.\nThe product is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 18 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 36 \\cdot 72$.\nIndeed, each pair $(d, 72/d)$ multiplies to $72$, and there are $6$ such pairs, implying the overall product is $72^6$. Now, we must determine whether there is yet a smaller solution that fits the conditions.\n\nTo affirmatively confirm, consider the fourth case, $p_1^3 p_2^2 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 72$, which effectively produces the least value of $n$ with exactly 12 divisors $k = 12$ fulfilling $n^{k/2} = n^6$.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which the product of its divisors equals $n^6$ is\n\\[\\boxed{72}.\\]", "round 1": "To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) whose positive divisors have a product equal to \\( n^6 \\), we use the property that states the product of all divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( n^{T(n)/2} \\), where \\( T(n) \\) is the total number of divisors of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven that the product of divisors equals \\( n^6 \\), we need:\n\\[ n^{T(n)/2} = n^6 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ T(n)/2 = 6 \\]\nleading to:\n\\[ T(n) = 12 \\]\n\nWe thus need \\( n \\) such that it has exactly 12 divisors. Let's examine possible factorizations of \\( n \\) based on \\( T(n) \\):\n1. \\( n = p^{11} \\)\n2. \\( n = p_1^5p_2 \\)\n3. \\( n = p_1^3p_2^2 \\)\n4. \\( n = p_1p_2p_3p_4 \\)\n5. \\( n = p_1^2p_2^1p_3^2 \\)\n\nThe task is to identify the smallest \\( n \\) from these forms.
