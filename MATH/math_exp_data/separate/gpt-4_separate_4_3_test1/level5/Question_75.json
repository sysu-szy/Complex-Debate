To find the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common, we'll go through the geometric relationships and calculations in detail:\n\n1. **Sides of the $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ Triangle**:\n   - In a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, the sides are in the ratio \\(1:\\sqrt{3}:2\\), corresponding to the lengths opposite the $30^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$ angles respectively.\n   - Given the shorter leg (opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle) is \\(6\\) units, the lengths of the sides are:\n     - Shorter leg \\(x = 6\\) units\n     - Longer leg \\(x\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3}\\) units\n     - Hypotenuse \\(2x = 12\\) units\n\n2. **Equilateral Triangle Sides**:\n   - Since the hypotenuse of the right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, each side of the equilateral triangle is also \\(12\\) units.\n\n3. **Vertices Configuration**:\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\(A\\) as the vertex at the right angle of the right triangle.\n     - \\(B\\) as the vertex at the $60^\\circ$ angle of the right triangle.\n     - \\(C\\) as the vertex where the hypotenuse and shorter leg meet.\n     - \\(D\\) as the third vertex of the equilateral triangle not shared with the right triangle.\n\n4. **Calculation of Vertical Distance Between Vertex \\(B\\) and \\(D\\)**:\n   - Since \\(C\\) (where the hypotenuse and shorter leg meet) is a common vertex, and we are looking for the distance between \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), we need to recognize that \\(BD\\) is along the altitude of the equilateral triangle.\n   - The altitude (\\(h\\)) of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula \\(h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\text{side length}\\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\sqrt{3} \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n   - This altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two identical $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangles, meaning each segment from the common vertex \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) (through \\(A\\) and perpendicular to \\(CA\\)) is precisely \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\) units.\n\n5. **Distance \\(BD\\)**:\n   - Since \\(BD\\) runs along the same line as \\(AD\\) and \\(AC\\), and forms the entire height \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\) of the equilateral triangle, the correct distance from \\(B\\) to \\(D\\) is just the full altitude:\n     \\[\n     BD = 6\\sqrt{3} \\text{ units}\n     \\]\n\nSo, the final answer to the query about the distance between vertices \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]", "round 2": "Upon examining the problem setup and the detailed descriptions provided, we aim to find the distance between two specific vertices in a geometric configuration involving a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ right triangle and an equilateral triangle, where the right triangle\u2019s hypotenuse is a side of the equilateral triangle.
