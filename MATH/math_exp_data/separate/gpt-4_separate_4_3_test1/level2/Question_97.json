We check positive integers ending in 4 or 9 until we find one which is 2 more than a multiple of 3: 4 is 1 more than a multiple of 3, 9 is a multiple of 3, and $\\boxed{14}$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \nFirstly, we know from the given $X$ equals to $2$ more than a multiple of $3$, that means $X$ can be written as $3n + 2$ for some integer $n$.\n\nRound 2: \nWe are also given that the units digit, the last digit, of $X$ is the same as that of a number which is $4$ more than a multiple of $5$, and this number can be written as $5m + 4$ for some integer $m$. This suggests that the last digit of $3n + 2$ is same as $5m + 4$, and this last digit can only be $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$ or $9$. \n\nRound 3: \nRecall that we are asked for the smallest possible value of $X$, we begin experimenting with the least possible multiples of $3$ and $5$ respectively. \n\nStarting with $n=0$, we find that $3n + 2$ gives a units digit of $2$. Checking to see which multiple of $5$ plus $4$ equals a last digit of $2$, we find $m=2$ works because $5(2) + 4 = 14$, which also has a units digit $4$.\n\nTherefore, for these values of $n$ and $m$, $X$ equals $3n + 2 = 3(0) + 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value for $X$ is \\boxed{2}.\n", "round 1": "Analyzing the reasoning from the other agents, it seems there is a common misconception that the value of $X$ must also be a multiple of 5 or 3.

The smallest value of $n$ is zero, since it suggests $X=2$.\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"the units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5\".

The first statement tells us that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. The symbol for \"multiple\" in mathematics is the equivalent of multiplication \"x\". Since we don't know what multiple of 3 $X$ is, we can use a variable, say $n$. So we can write $X$ as $3n + 2$.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that the units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. We can establish a new variable, say $m$, keeping in mind that the units digit is identical. We then have $5m + 4$, whose units digit is equal to that of $3n + 2$.\n\nRound 2:\nOur goal is to find the smallest positive integer $X$ that satisfies both equations.\n\nWe'll need to consider what the units digits of multiples of 3 and 5 can be.

For 5, they're always 0 or 5.\n\nBecause $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3, the possible units digits of $X$ (our $3n + 2$ expression) are {0,3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7}, a shifting of the multiples of 3.\n\nSimilarly, because our second number is 4 more than a multiple of 5, the possible units digits (our $5m + 4$ expression) are {4,9}, a shifting of the multiples of 5.\n\nRound 3:\nFor $X$ to hold true, the units digit has to be present in both sets. Comparing the 2 lists of possible units digits, we realize they only intersect at 9.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $X$ must be 9, and $X$ itself should be the smallest number with a units digit of 9 that fits the remaining condition of being 2 more than a multiple of 3. \n\nRound 4: \nHere, we need to find the smallest positive integer which has 9 as its units digit and, at the same time, is 2 more than a multiple of 3.\n\nWe have a simple arithmetic progression in 3s: {0,3,6,9,12,15,....}. Thus, adding 2 to each term, we get {2,5,8,11,14,17,...}. Observing these numbers, the smallest possible integer with a units digit of 9, that is 2 more than a multiple of 3 is 11 but the question specifies the units digit to be same as of multiples of 5 + 4, this indicates the unit digit has to be 4 or 9.
