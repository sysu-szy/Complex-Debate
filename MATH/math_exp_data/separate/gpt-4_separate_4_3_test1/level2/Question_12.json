The fourth root of a number is the value that, when raised to the power of 4, equals the original number. It's important to note that when we take the fourth root of both sides of an inequality, the inequality sign stays the same because raising a positive number to an even power (like 4) keeps the number positive, so the relative ordering of the numbers doesn't change.\n\nThe fourth root of 100,000,000 is 178. Therefore, x > 178.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the smallest positive integer solution for x. Since x must be greater than 178, and we're looking for an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 179.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer solution to the inequality $(100,000,000 \\div x^4 ) < 1$ is \\boxed{179}.", "round 1": "It has come to my attention that my original solution was incorrect.
