Here's how to work it out.\n\nFirst, let's denote the repeating decimal by x:\n\nx = 0.5454...\n\nThe reason we do this is because x is an unknown number we want to find. Since it continues indefinitely, we can't simply count it up. Instead, we need a way to manipulate this repeating decimal.\n\nNext, because the 54 repeats, we can create an equation that represents this repeating part by multiplying x by 100:\n\n100x = 54.5454...\n\nThis equation expresses the same number as before, but shifted two places to the right. Why do we do this? Well, if we subtract the equation x = 0.5454... from the equation 100x = 54.5454..., the repeating part will cancel out.\n\nSo now, we subtract the first equation from the second one:\n\n100x - x = 54.5454... - 0.5454...\n\nThis simplifies to 99x = 54\n\nFinally, we solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 99:\n\nx = 54/99\n\nHowever, we want our fraction in lowest terms, which means we should divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
