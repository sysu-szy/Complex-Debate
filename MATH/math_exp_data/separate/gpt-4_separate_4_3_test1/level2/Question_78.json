One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\n\nLet's try to break down the product as evenly as possible. \n\nSince the product of the digits is 12 and the number is 3 digits long, too large a digit can cause the product to exceed 12.
