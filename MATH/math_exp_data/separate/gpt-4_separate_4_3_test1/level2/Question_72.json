So, we must figure out how many $15$ minute intervals are in $2$ hours to calculate the total increase in temperature.\n\nThere are $60$ minutes in an hour, so $2$ hours would yield $2*60 = 120$ minutes. Knowing this, we can simply divide the total minutes in $2$ hour by the $15$ minute intervals to figure out how many $1.5$ degree temperature rises occur in $2$ hours.\n\nThus, $120$ minutes divided by $15$ minutes equates to $120/15 = 8$ intervals.\n\nSince the temperature rises $1.5$ degrees every $15$ minutes, and we've found that there are $8$ intervals of $15$ minutes in $2$ hours, we multiply the rate $1.5$ degrees by $8$ intervals.\n\nSo, the temperature will rise by $1.5 * 8 = 12$ degrees in $2$ hours, if the rate of increase remains constant.\n\nOur final answer is \\boxed{12}.", "round 1": "Reflecting upon the solutions from other agents, I stand by my initial solution and process to solve this problem, which aligns with the other solutions provided.\n\nWe are given that the temperature increases at a rate of 1.5 degrees per 15 minutes.

We achieve this by dividing the total minutes in 2 hours (120) by the interval length (15), giving us 8 intervals.\n\nFinally, we multiply the temperature increase per interval (1.5 degrees) by the number of intervals in 2 hours (8), giving us the total expected temperature rise if the rate remains constant.\n\nThat is, 1.5 degrees x 8 = 12 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the temperature is expected to rise by \\boxed{12} degrees in the next 2 hours if the rate of increase remains constant.", "round 2": "Each of the solutions provided by the agents is consistent with my original process and solution.
