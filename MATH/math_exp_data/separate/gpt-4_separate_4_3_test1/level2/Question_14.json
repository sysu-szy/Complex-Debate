For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "For a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4. \n\nFirstly, let's test the divisibility by 4. According to the rule, a number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4. So we test all possible values of $d$ from 0 to 9.\n\nThe possible two-digit numbers that end in 8 are 08, 18, 28, ..., 98. Among these, the numbers divisible by 4 are 08, 28, 48, 68, and 88. So the possible values for $d$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's look at the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in $591{,}3d8$ is $5 + 9 + 1 + 3 + d + 8 = 26 + d$. \n\nOf our potential candidates for $d$ (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), we test if $26 + d$ is divisible by 3. It's easy to see that none of $26 + 0$, $26 + 2$, $26 + 6$, or $26 + 8$ are divisible by 3, however $26 + 4$ equals 30, which is divisible by 3. \n\nTherefore, the only digit $d$ that makes $591{,}3d8$ divisible by 12 is 4. \n\nSo, the sum of all the digits that could replace $d$ is simply 4, and gives the final answer as \\boxed{4}.", "round 1": "From my initial reasoning, I reasoned that the number must be divisible by both 3 and 4 in order to be divisible by 12.\n\nI used the divisibility rule of 4 to narrow down the possible values of $d$ to be 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nThen, through checking the divisibility by 3, I arrived at the conclusion that $d=4$ is the only value that ensures $591{,}3d8$ to be divisible by 12.\n\nAgent 0 gave a different solution, but ended up with the same result. The reasoning followed the same path by applying the divisibility rules of 3 and 4 and finding possible values of $d$ that meet both conditions. The agent eventually arrived at $d=4$ as the only viable solution.\n\nAgent 1 followed a similar path, but calculated the possible values for $d$ differently. Rather than directly applying the divisibility rule of 3 as I did, this agent calculated the possible values for $d$ to make $26+d$ divisible by 3. This ended up with three potential values for $d$, but combined with the divisibility rule of 4, only $d=4$ satisfies both conditions. \n\nFinally, Agent 2 seems to have made an error in the calculation for the divisibility by 3. They calculated possible values for $d$ based on the divisibility rule for 3 and ended up with seven values. This agent also found five values for $d$ based on the rule for divisibility by 4. When checking for values that meet both conditions, they wrongly concluded that there are three: 0, 2, and 6. This does not match the conditions for the divisibility by 3 and seems to be an error in their calculation. \n\nSo after carefully reassessing my solution and the solutions of other agents, I am confident that the solution found that $d=4$ is the only viable option for the number to be divisible by 12.

As $8$ is already a multiple of $4$, $d$ must be even for the two-digit number to be divisible by $4$. Thus, the potential values of $d$ using this rule are $0, 2, 4, 6,$ and $8$.\n\nOn the other hand, the divisibility rule of 3 states that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.
