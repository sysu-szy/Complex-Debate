From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock.

Therefore, each hour mark is 360 degrees/12 hours = 30 degrees apart. \n\nRound 2: Calculate the initial and final angles based on the placement of the hands on the steering wheel\n\nThe hands are initially at \"3\" and \"9\". There are 6 hours between 3 and 9 on a clock, so the angle between the hands is 6 hours * 30 degrees/hour = 180 degrees. \n\nWhen the hands are moved to \"2\" and \"10\", there are 8 hours between 2 and 10 on a clock, so the new angle is 8 hours * 30 degrees/hour = 240 degrees. \n\nRound 3: Determine the decrease in the angle\n\nThe initial angle was 180 degrees and the final angle is 240 degrees. To find the decrease in the angle, we subtract the final angle from the initial one: 240 degrees - 180 degrees = 60 degrees. \n\nThe rotation from 9 to 10 increases the angle by 30 degrees because it is one hour's worth of rotation. The rotation from 3 to 2 increases the angle by another 30 degrees. Therefore, the total increase is 60 degrees.\n\nHowever, since the question asks by how many degrees the angle would decrease, we need to consider this increase as a negative change.

Each hour mark corresponds to 30 degrees on a traditional clock face, so each hand has moved 30 degrees. Considering the movement of both hands, this actually reduces the angle between the hands by 60 degrees (2 hands * 30 degrees/hand). \n\nTherefore, reiterating this in terms of the decrease asked by the question, we are correct to establish that the angle would decrease by 60 degrees.\n\nLooking at the solution presented by Agent 1, it appears there is a significant misinterpretation of the problem. The scenario described does not fully reflect the situation and leads to a mistaken conclusion that the angle decreased by 180 degrees which is incorrect.\n\nAgent 2's solution completely aligns with my final conclusion.

The clock is divided into 12 hours, the same number of segments that are theoretically on the steering wheel. Therefore, each 'hour' or segment signifies an angle of 30 degrees (since a full circle or clock face consists of 360 degrees).\n\nIn the original position, the hands at \"$3$'' and \"$9$'' essentially cut the steering wheel (or clock face) in half, creating a straight line or an angle of 180 degrees.\n\nHowever, when the hands are moved to \"$2$'' and \"$10$'', they are no longer directly opposite each other. Each hand has moved by one 'hour' or 30 degrees towards the top of the clock. Thus, both hands together have moved a total of 60 degrees closer to each other. \n\nThis shows that the angle between the two hands has indeed decreased. To precisely measure how much the angle has decreased, we subtract the new position's degree measure from the original's. As such, we find that the angle decrease is $180 - 120 = 60$ degrees.\n\nTo conclude, the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) would decrease by 60 degrees.

When the hands are positioned on 3 and 9, they are at an angle of 180 degrees. This is because each is exactly 6 increments away from 12 (which is the top of the clock), and 6 times 30 equals 180.\n\nRound 3:\nNext, we need to find the new position of the hands when they are placed on 2 and 10.

Instead of calculating the angle from one hand to another, it's better to calculate the total angle from the 2 to 12 and from 12 to 10. The angle from 2 to 12 is 4 hours times 30 degrees/hour which is 120 degrees. The angle from 10 to 12 is 2 hours times 30 degrees/hour which is 60 degrees. So, the angle made between 2 and 10 would be the sum of those two angles, which equals to 180 degrees.\n\nRound 4:\nFinally, to find how much the angle has decreased by, we subtract our new angle from our initial angle. In this case, 180 degrees (3 and 9) minus 180 degrees (2 and 10) equals 0.\n\nTherefore, moving the hands from 3 and 9 to 2 and 10 doesn't change the angle, hence the decrease in angle is \\boxed{0}.", "round 2": "Examining the original problem, the students were told to move their hands from the \"$3$\" and \"$9$\" positions to the \"$2$\" and \"$10$\" positions.

Therefore, it is clear that the mistake was in not considering the decrease not as the overall position of the hands but the individual movement of each hand.\n\nAs per the logic provided by agents, each 'hour' on the clock represents a segment of 30 degrees. Therefore, the position at \"$3$\" or \"$9$\" is 90 degrees from 12. When one hand moves from \"$3$\" to the \"$2$\" position, it moves by a segment of 30 degrees.

The angle between '2' and '10' on the clock is not calculated by simply adding the angles from '2' to '12' and from '10' to '12'.
