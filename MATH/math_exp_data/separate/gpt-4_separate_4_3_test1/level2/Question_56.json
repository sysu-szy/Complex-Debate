Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's denote the number of adult tickets sold as $a$, and the number of children's tickets sold as $c$.
