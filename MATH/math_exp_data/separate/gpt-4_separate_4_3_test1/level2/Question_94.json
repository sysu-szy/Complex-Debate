This is apparent when we look at smaller cubes like:\n\n- 3^3 = 27\n- 7^3 = 343\n- 17^3 = 4913\n\nNo matter the first or middle digits, a number ending in 7 when cubed, its last digit will always be 3.\n\nSo, L=3. \n\nNow let's find F. Note that the cubic of any number in the form of 20XX will have a first digit of 8.

This can be done by understanding how numbers behave when they are cubed.\n\nLet's first figure out the last digit of $2007^3$. Any number ending in 7 when cubed will always end in 3, this we can observe from smaller cube numbers like $3^3=27, 7^3=343, 17^3=4913$, etc. Therefore, the last digit $L$ of the number $2007^3$ is 3.\n\nNext, let's find out the first digit of $2007^3$. Any number that begins with 20, when cubed, always starts with an 8. We can see this in numbers like $2^3=8, 20^3=8000, 200^3=8000000$, etc. So, the first digit $F$ of the number $2007^3$ is 8.\n\nThe sum of the first and last digits of $2007^3$ is therefore, $F+L=8+3=11$.\n\nIn conclusion, the solution to the problem is \\boxed{11}.", "round 2": "Following the logic used by all agents in this problem, we first establish the last digit $L$ of $2007^3$. \n\nWe take advantage of the cyclic nature of the last digit when a number ending in 7 is cubed. The cyclicity we discovered was (7, 9, 3, 1). This means that the recurrence of the last digit repeats every 4 terms, and in the case of cube, the last digit inevitably is 3.\n\nWe can therefore confidently determine that the last digit $L$ of $2007^3$ is 3.\n\nSecondly, we have to find the first digit $F$ of $2007^3$ without performing the cube operation. \n\nWe do so by using estimation. Logic dictates that since 2007 falls between 2000 and 3000, the cube of 2007 will fall between the cubes of 2000 and 3000. \n\nTherefore $2000^3=8,000,000,000<2007^3<3000^3=27,000,000,000$\n\nThis implies that the first digit of $2007^3$, denoted as $F$, will be 8. Consequently, $F$ is 8.\n\nIn conclusion, given that $F$ and $L$ are the first and last digits of $2007^3$ respectively, the sum of $F$ and $L$ is $F+L=8+3=11$. \n\nMy final answer thus remains \\boxed{11}. This is in agreement with the solutions given by the other agents, further confirming its correctness."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: Estimation\n\nThe first step to solving this problem is to estimate the magnitude of $2007^3$; this will help us find the first digit of the integer. I do this by using powers of 10 approximations. Specifically, we know that 2000 < 2007 < 3000, so $8,000,000,0000 = (2000)^3 < 2007^3 < (3000)^3 = 27,000,000,000$. Hence, $F$ must be a digit between 8 and 27, i.e. $F=8$ or $F=9$.\n\nRound 2: Units Digit\n\nTo calculate the last digit of the $2007^3$, we can take advantage of the cyclical property of units digits (i.e., the fact that the units digits of powers of any given integer repeat in a certain pattern). This pattern usually depends on the units digit of the base number. The base number here is 7 (the units digit of 2007), which has a cyclicity of 4: that is, the units digits of powers of 7 go 7, 9, 3, and 1, and then repeat. Now, 2007 is a multiple of 4, so the units digit of $2007^3$ is the same as the units digit of $7^3$. Therefore, $L=3$.\n\nRound 3: Determining F\n\nWe've already estimated that $8$ billion <$2007^3$ < $27$ billion, and the only possible values for $F$ would be $8$ or $9$. We can further narrow this down by refining our estimate: $2007$ is very close to $2000$, and $(2000+\\delta)^3$ increases more slowly than $2000^3$ by roughly $3*2000^2*\\delta$ (by the binomial theorem), which is much smaller than $1$ billion when $\\delta=7$.

We used similar reasoning and methodologies to solve the problem, prioritizing the analysis of cyclicity for the last digit and estimating for the first digit. \n\nReaffirmation of My Solution:\n\n1. Cycle for the last digit: We observed that the cycles for the last digit of the powers of 7 repeat every four terms (7, 9, 3, 1). We were sure the last digit $L$ of $2007^3$ was 3 since the cubic power of any number ending with 7 always ends with 3. This characteristic of number cycles was accurately used in solving for $L$.\n\n2. Obtaining the first digit: To get the first digit of $2007^3$ ($F$) without having to do the cube, we compared it with the cubes of 2000 and 3000. We concluded that $2000^3=8,000,000,000 < 2007^3 < 3000^3=27,000,000,000$ and so the first digit of $2007^3$ could only be 8. \n\nHence, combining the first and last digits revealed the value of $F+L$ to be $8+3=\\boxed{11}$, which remains my final answer.

Here's how I arrived at it, step-by-step:\n\nStep 1. Identify cyclicity for last digit:\nIn mathematics, the term \"cyclicity\" refers to the pattern in which the last digit of the powers of a number repeat. For the number 7, the cycle repeats after every 4 terms (7, 9, 3, 1). By utilizing this fact, we deduced that cubing any number ending with 7 results in an answer ending with 3.

Approximate for first digit:\nTo determine the first digit $F$ of $2007^3$, I compared it to the cube of the nearest \"comfortable\" numbers, 2000 and 3000. \n$2000^3=8,000,000,000$ and $3000^3=27,000,000,000$. $2007^3$ lies between these two values and hence includes the first digit of $2000^3$, which is 8. Therefore, $F = 8$.\n\nStep 3. Find $F+L$:\nFinally, we simply added the first and last digits together, resulting in $F+L = 8+3=\\boxed{11}$ which is the final answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the validation of my solution with those of other agents buttresses its correctness with no need for any changes."}, {"round 0": "The first step in this process would be to find the value of $2007^3$. \n\nBy calculating, we get $2007^3 = 8,084,342,343$.\n\nTherefore, the first digit $F$ of this expanded integer is $8$ and the last digit $L$ is $3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of these two digits, so we simply add them together.\n\n$F + L = 8 + 3 = 11$\n\nThus \\boxed{11} is the final answer.", "round 1": "As the previous solutions have pointed out, the problem can be separated into two distinct parts: finding the last digit or $L$, and finding the first digit or $F$. \n\nTo find $L$, we can consider that the last digit of a number raised to a power depends only on the last digit of the base number. The cyclical nature of the units digit after multiplication, especially in the case of the number 7, makes the process more manageable. \nThe unit digit of 7 when cubed always remains 3, regardless of the other digits. Therefore, $L = 3$.\n\nFor determining $F$, the number 2007 lies between 2000 and 3000.

However, there are some cuts and shortcuts that are available due to the given constraints that can turn the problem into a simpler form. This mathematical trick helps us get to the answer quicker without having to do very demanding multiplication.\n\nRound 1 - Analyzing the Last Digit:\n\nThis problem is broken into two parts. We shall first find $L$, which is the last digit of the expansion. In number theory, the last digit of a result of multiplication only depends on the last digit of the numbers being multiplied. This fact is particularly striking because no matter how large the numbers are, understanding the cyclicity of the last digit can lead us to the last digit of the result.\n\nAs such, when analyzing last digit, we only care about the last digit of 2007, which is 7. We know that the units digit 7 has a cyclicity of 4:\n\n- $7^1$ has the last digit 7.\n- $7^2$ or $49$ has the last digit 9.\n- $7^3$ or $343$ has the last digit 3.\n- $7^4$ or $2401$ has the last digit 1.\n- After the fourth power, the units digit repeats itself.\n\nSince we are looking for the last digit of $2007^3$, we are effectively looking for the last digit of $7^3$, which is 3. Thus, $L = 3$.\n\nRound 2 - Analyzing the First Digit:\n\nFinding the first digit is slightly tricky as it is not as straightforward as finding the last digit. The good news is that $2000 < 2007 < 3000$. This allows us to estimate the bounds of $F$ by cubing that is done over the substring $200$ and $300$, and observing the first digit.\n\n- $2000^3 = 8,000,000,000$\n- $3000^3 = 27,000,000,000$\n\n2007, to the third power, would therefore fall somewhere between these two integers. The fact that the first digit of $2000^3$ is 8 and the first digit of $3000^3$ is 2 suggests that $2007^3$, a number falling in between, will start with a 8. Thus, $F = 8$.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLet's put together $L$ and $F$. Thus, the desired sum of the first and last digits of the expanded integer form of $2007^3$ is $F + L = 8 + 3 = 11$.

This is because, interestingly enough, the last digit of a result of multiplication only hinges on the last digit of the numbers being multiplied. Hence, we only concern ourselves with the last digit of 2007 which is 7. Applying cyclicity, we have that the units digit of $7^3$ is 3, thus $L=3$.\n\nIn round 2, we tackle the task of finding the first digit $F$. I came to understand that finding $F$ isn\u2019t as straightforward as finding $L$. However, we are able to make an educated guess about what $F$ would be by considering that 2007 falls between 2000 and 3000 and thereby cubing the numbers 200 and 300 then observing the first digit. The cube of 2000 gives us a number starting with 8 while the cube of 3000 starts with 27. Therefore, it\u2019s safe to say that the cube of a number between 2000 and 3000 will start with 8 meaning $F=8$. \n\nWith both $F$ and $L$, the problem requests the sum $F+L$, so we simply add 8 and 3 to get $F+L=8+3=11$ .\n\nSo, my final answer, updating from the previous solution, is \\boxed{11}.

First, we need to find the last digit, denoted by $L$, of the number $2007^3$. Second, we are to identify the first digit, denoted by $F$ of the same number.
