This means we increase the value of the digit in the place we're rounding to by 1.\n\nSince the digit in the thousandths place is '9' which is greater than 5, we should therefore round up the digit in the hundredth (which is '0') by one.\n\nSo, rounding $563.5097$ to the nearest hundredth would give us $563.51$.\n\nThus, we conclude that $563.5097$, when rounded to the nearest hundredth is \\boxed{563.51}.", "round 1": "The number we're given to round to the nearest hundredth is $563.5097$. \n\nIn order to round to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the value in the thousandths place, the digit after the hundredths place. \n\nThe hundredths place is represented by the digit '0', while the thousandths place is represented by '9'. \n\nIn rounding, if the digit in the place value immediately after the one to which we're rounding - in this case, the thousandths place - is 5 or greater, we round up, adding 1 to the value in the place to which we're rounding. \n\nHere, the value in the thousandths place is 9, which is greater than 5. \n\nTherefore, we round up the hundredth place value by adding 1 to 0, which results in the value of 1.
