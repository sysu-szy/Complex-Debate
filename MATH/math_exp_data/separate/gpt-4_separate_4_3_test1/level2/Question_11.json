The total area of the rectangle is found by multiplying its width and length, and so we have $w*4w = 4w^2$.\n\nThe shaded area consists of two separate triangles. Triangle $ABE$ has a base which is equivalent to $w$, as it is aligned along the width of the rectangle, while its height, $BE$, runs along the length of the rectangle, and is therefore $4w$. The area of this triangle, based on the formula for the area of a triangle, would be $0.5*base*height = 0.5*w*4w = 2w^2.$\n\nSimilarly, triangle $DCE$ has $CD$ as its base, equivalent to $w$, while its height is $4w$. So, $DCE$'s area is likewise $2w^2$.\n\nThe shaded portion is the combined area of the two triangles, therefore $2w^2+2w^2 = 4w^2$.\n\nNow, we divide the area of the shaded portion by the total area to get the fraction (which we can convert to a percentage by multiplying by 100): $4w^2/4w^2*100 = 100.$\n\nTherefore, the shaded area occupies 100% of the total area of the rectangle, so the answer, \\boxed{{100}}, remains the same.\n\nAs I review the solutions of other agents in this debate, it is apparent that each solution approaches the problem with slightly different methods or angles, but ultimately confirms the correctness of my initial solution.
