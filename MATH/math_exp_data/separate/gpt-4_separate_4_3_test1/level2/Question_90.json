For $x^2+x+1=0$ we have a quadratic equation whose determinant is $1^2 - 4*1*1= -3 < 0$, so there are no real solutions meaning we don't have to exclude any roots.

But the above cubic equation seems un-factorable. So, we move to the numerical method. We used Cardano's method in our previous solution. However, another approach is using the Rational Root Theorem to guess possible rational roots.\n\nThis theorem says that if a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational root, then that root must be a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, we have leading coefficient 1 and constant term 2 so the only rational candidates are $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 2$. Substituting these into the cubic equation, we find that none of them are roots.\n\nSo, we might suspect that this equation has no rational roots, which also implies no integer roots. However, there are still possibly irrational roots, and indeed complex roots since a cubic polynomial always has three roots in the complex plane.\n\nTo check whether the remaining roots are real or complex, we can use the discriminant. The discriminant of a cubic equation $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $\\Delta = -4a^3d + a^2b^2 + 18abcd - 4b^3 - 27c^2$ which simplifies to $\\Delta = 18abd - 4b^3 - 4a^3d - 27c^2 + a^2b^2$.\n\nIn our case, $a=0$, $b=2$ and $d=2$, so after substituting we get $\\Delta = -32 < 0$.\n\nThe discriminant being negative implies that the equation has one real root and two non-real complex roots. However, as we have already observed that none of $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 2$ were roots and we deducted there are no rational roots, we conclude that the real root must be irrational. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is no simple closed form expression for the root that can be derived by elementary methods. \n\nThus, although there is a root, it can't be expressed in the form $\\boxed{{answer}}$.
