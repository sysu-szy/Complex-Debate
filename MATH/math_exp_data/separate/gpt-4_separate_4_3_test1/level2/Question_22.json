Therefore, this leaves us with a total of 50 - 6 = 44 students who participate in either or both clubs.\n\nSecondly, we know that 28 students participate in MATHCOUNTS and 21 students participate in science club. If we add these two quantities, we get 28 + 21 = 49 students. This number represents all students who participate in MATHCOUNTS, all students who participate in science club, including those who may participate in both.\n\nHowever, we notice that this number 49 is higher than the number 44 that we calculated earlier. This discrepancy is due to the fact that some students participate in both the MATHCOUNTS and science club, and these students have been counted twice - once for MATHCOUNTS and once more for science club. \n\nTo correct this over-counting, we should subtract the total number of students who participate in either or both clubs (which is 44) from the total number of students counted as participating in math and science (which is 49).

Combined, this gives us 28 + 21 = 49 students. \n\nThis count, however, is greater than the 44 students we have accounted for, indicating some overlap.

Therefore, adding 28 and 21 should equal 50 minus 6, or 44, since the rest of the students are participating in either the MATHCOUNTS or the science club.\n\nTherefore, we can create this equation: 28 (MATHCOUNTS) + 21 (science club) - x (the overlapping students who are in both clubs) = 44 (total students participating in an activity).
