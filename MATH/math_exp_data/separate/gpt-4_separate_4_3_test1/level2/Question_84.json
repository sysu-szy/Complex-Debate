Since $E\\ne G$, it must be that $E+1=G$ in order to get $G$ in the hundreds place. Since a $1$ is carried over, we have $G+G=10+M$. Now we look at the units place. Either $M+M=M$ or $M+M=10+M$.

So E = 0.\n\nG + G gives out M. G+G is less than 20 and if we substract 10 (the one in the tens place), we have a number less than 10. Therefore M is an even number. With the condition of M+M = 20, M has to be 0, which contradicts with E = 0 because each letter represents a distinct digit. Therefore G+G has a carry. G is definitely not 0 or 5 with the carry, because 5+5=10 and it doesn't satisfy the condition of M. Therefore G is at least 5 and with the carry, M is even number between 1 and 9. \n\nM is in the unit place in the second row, therefore M is larger than 5, otherwise it would change G or introduce another digit. Therefore M equals 6,7,8,9. With 2G = 10 + M, M is not 6 or 8 which doesn't meet the condition of G. Therefore M can only be 7 or 9. Since G+G with carry should be less than 20, so M cannot be 9.

This implies that E = 0.\n\nLet's move to where the agents disagree. They seem mainly to disagree on the values of both M and G, which further impact the value of E. \n\nAgent Solution0 suggests given that M + M = G should carry a digit, G cannot be 0, and therefore G = 5. However, this implies 5 + 5 = 10, which does not match with M + M = G. Given this contradiction, we can't deem Agent Solution0 as valid.\n\nAgent Solution1 and Agent Solution2 suggest M = 0, while Agent Solution0 says M = 7. We disagree with Solution2's suggestion that if G = 1, then M = 0. The deriving of digits from 1 is completely random and doesn't follow a logical induction.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Agent Solution1's logic. He concluded that since G + G with carryover is equal to M and that M + M = G, M must equal 0. This dominoed into concluding E to be 8. However, this logic is flawed because M=0 contradicts the fact that M + M = G with G non-zero. Moreover E=8 makes it impossible for E+G=G to hold true as well.\n\nEliminating these suggestions, We can also eliminate the answer suggested by Agent Solution2 since his assertion that G = 1 and M = 0 seemed without basis.\n\nTherefore, after thorough analysis, we can conclude that the original answer, E = 0, is the most accurate.\n\nSo, the final correct answer to the problem is \\boxed{0}.", "round 2": "After reviewing the responses of the other agents, I'd like to clarify and provide my final reasoning.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Looking at the M's column, where M + M = M, it's clear that M must be 0, since no other digit can double to become itself.\n\nStep 2: Given the G's column, where G+G yields a two-digit number, we can deduce that G must be 5 because it's the only value for G that can double to produce a sum in the tens.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering the E's column, we know that since we're in the hundreds place and we're dealing with single digits here, E + G = G implies that E = 0. However, M is already 0, and we cannot have two digits representing the same number. Also, G cannot be 0 because we have already established that G must equal 5.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the only possibility left for E is 4 because the sum 4 + 5 equals 9 and carries 1, which fits the conditions we've deduced.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion is that E = \\boxed{4}."}, {"round 0": "Let's start the solution by working on from least significant digit to most significant digit.\n\n1st Round: \nObserving the unit place, we see that M + M = M, it can be concluded that M = 0, no other digit would add to itself and yield a result of itself excluding 0.\n\n2nd round:\nThen from the tens place, we add G + G, yielding M, which we already established is 0. Hence G + G = 0. This means G = 0 / 2 = 0. However, we have established that M = 0, and since different letters must be different digits, G must equal 5, so the result of G + G will roll over to the next tens spot.\n\n3rd round:\nLastly, observing the hundreds place, after we carry 1 from the G's addition, we find that E + 1 = G.

However, as other agents have pointed out, the constraint G + G = 10 + M leads us to conclude that G must be 5, given that it's the only number that when doubled, rolls over to the next tens spot, giving M = 0. This further leads us to conclude that E + 1 = G, and hence E = 4.\n\nRevisiting these two different paths of reasoning, I am confident that my original answer is correct, and that E = \\boxed{4}.", "round 2": "Reviewing the original task and the responses by other agents, it is clear that the solutions are divided mostly due to different interpretations of how the carrying in the additions works. By applying basic arithmetic knowledge, let's review the equations.\n\n1. The first equation from the task is M + M = G. Since the same numbers are added together, the result of this operation will be even. Also, due to the constraints of the task, it must be a single digit - making M equal to 0 the only possible solution to fulfill both these conditions.\n\n2. The second one is G + G = 10 + M (which has been established to be 0) and thus equals 10. Therefore, the only sensible value for G would be 5.\n\n3. Finally, looking at the third equation E + G (which is 5) = 10 + G, we see that E + 5 = 10 + 5, and thus we can conclude that E = 10.\n\nHowever, because E must represent a single digit, we need to adjust our interpretation of the carrying operation in this equation. More logical seems to be considering G as the result of the operation E + 1.

This also means E can range from 0 - 9 but since we defined M = 0, E cannot be 0 and is thus from 1 -9. Moreover, E + M > 10 which means E can now range from 1 -9 ( removing 0 from the option to include the carry 1 condition.)\n\nRound 2:\nFurther, we know G + G cannot be zero as G cannot be 0 because if G were equal to zero then M will have a value of 5 but we have already set M = 0. This means E is equal to an even number from 1 - 9 because G + G = E which should be essentially odd + odd = even.\n\nRound 3:\nFrom the 2 rounds, we only get two possible values for E, 2 & 8. However, G cannot be equal to 1 or 4 because it will make M greater than 10 and we already know M = 0. Thus, the potential options for E are now drastically reduced.\n\nRound 4:\nConsequently, using all the evidence above, we can confidently arrive to our conclusion E = 0 + 2G, where G is 4 hence E = 0 + 2*4 = 8. \nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}.", "round 1": "Reviewing my original solution and the solutions provided by other agents, let's recalibrate and rethink the problem.\n\nRound 1: We know that M + M = M.

The only possibilities for G now are 0 and 5. But M is already 0 and since all letters are distinct digits, G must be 5.\n\nRound 3: Let's look at the hundreds place. E and G both are single digit number and if E+G=G then E = 0 or G = 0. But M = 0 and G = 5. So E = 0 is not valid since digits are unique. Even G = 0 is not valid because we have already calculated that G = 5. Therefore, the only possibility left is E+1 = G.

Therefore, M can represent 0 since 10 + 10 results in 20.\n\nBecause each digit must be different, the only digit E can represent in this case is 2 (since 1 and 0 are already represented by G and M respectively).

Since M is 0, G must be a number that when added to itself equals 10 which is 5 but it's contradicts the 1st round where G is 1. Therefore, In accordance with M being 0, G should be 1 and there should be a carryover, that's why there is 10 in the equation.\n\nStep 3:\nFinally, looking at the E's column, E + 1 (which is the carryover from the second G's column) equals G. This implies that E must be 0 but that would contradict with step one. Hence, the carryover should have been considered on the left side of the equation. So it should be E = G - 1. We have established G is 1 so E = 1 - 1 which is 0. However, because E cannot be 0 as M is 0 and all digits have to be distinct, E should instead be 2 because of the carryover from the G's column.\n\nTherefore, the final numerical value of E should indeed be \\boxed{2}.", "round 2": "As an individual proficient in mathematics, I am confident that my suggestion of E equalling 2 is accurate. I will take you through my reasoning to demonstrate this.\n\nStep 1 - Determining M:\nThe easiest place to start is to examine the digit M. Given M + M = M, as we see it in the units column, the only possible value for M is 0, since adding any other digit to itself will yield a different number. Thus, we can assign M a value of 0.\n\nStep 2 - Determining G:\nNext, let's move on to the tens column. Here we are looking at G + G, and note that the sum moved to the next column, hence the result is 10 + M. However, we established in step 1 that the value of M is 0, leaving us with 10. The number that, when added to itself yields 10, is 5. However, this creates a contradiction. We need to remember that, in addition to M being 0, it also has an effect on other columns. With M being 0, there's a carryover from the first column, making G equal to 1. \n\nStep 3 - Determining E:\nFinally, we move to the leftmost column. Here, we note that E is added to the carryover from the tens column, and the result is G. Since we have already established that the value of G is 1 and the value of the carryover 1, E must equal 0. However, since M is already zero, we lack a way to create a distinct value for E. This puzzle gets solved by considering the \u2018carry\u2019 from the middle column. The carry should have been included in this column, which would then give us E = 1 (carry) + G - 1. Substituting the known value of G into the equation gives E = 1 + 1 - 1, thus E = 1.\n\nHowever, E can't be 1 since G is 1 and all digits have to differ. The last position can only be filled by 2 (as 0 and 1 are taken by M and G, respectively), meaning that E must be 2. \n\nConsidering the reasoning from other agents and my original hypothesis, the final numerical value of E should indeed be \\boxed{2}."}]}
