{"question": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then what remainder does $2n+1$ give when divided by 7?", "answer": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Step 1: Since n gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can write n = 7k + 3 for some integer k. \n\nThe number n is thus expressed in a form which displays clearly that it's divisible by 7 with a remainder of 3. This is because if you divide n by 7, you get the quotient as k and remainder as 3. \n\nStep 2: Replacing n in the expression 2n + 1 with 7k + 3, we get 2(7k + 3) + 1, which simplifies to 14k + 6 + 1 or 14k + 7. \n\nThis simplification step has been achieved by merely distributing the multiplication across the sum inside the parentheses and then doing a bit of basic arithmetic addition. The 14k + 7 is our desired expression.\n\nStep 3: The number 14k is clearly divisible by 7, because 14 is divisible by 7. \nAlso, 7 is divisible by 7. This means that the whole number 14k + 7 is divisible by 7 with remainder of 0.\n\nReferencing back to our main problem, the expression 2n + 1 when divided by 7 gives the remainder 0.\n\nReasoning: The properties of divisibility help us analyze the two parts of our number separately.
