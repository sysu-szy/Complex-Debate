This would not change the arrangement because the two 'N's are indistinguishable. Similarly, each arrangement of \"NINE\" has been correspondingly counted twice in our initial count (once for each possible order of 'N's).\n\nTherefore, we have overcounted by a factor of 2 (the number of ways to arrange the two 'N's).

This would be correct if all the letters in the word were unique.\n\nHowever, this is not the case for the word \"NINE\"; the letter 'N' appears twice in this word, making some of these arrangements indistinguishable from one another. \n\nCounting indistinguishable arrangements as separate would lead to overcounting the total number of unique arrangements. Therefore, we must correct for this overcounting.\n\nWe make this correction by theoretically conceiving a swap of the two 'N's in any given arrangement. Each one of these swaps would not alter the arrangement because 'N's are indistinguishable, and yet each arrangement has been counted twice in our original computation, once for each conceivable arrangement of 'N's.\n\nThis indicates we have overcounted by a factor of '2' or more properly by 2!

As such, our original calculation of 24 arrangements precipitates over-counting. \n\nTo correct for this over-counting, we factor in the arrangements of the 2 'N's, which have been counted twice in each unique arrangement, due to their indistinguishability. 2 'N's could theoretically be arranged in 2! or 2 factorial ways, which is 2*1, amounting to 2 potential arrangements.
