What is the least possible sum?", "answer": "Let $2n-2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$ be four consecutive positive even integers. If $(2n-2)+(2n)+(2n+2)+(2n+4)=8n+4=2^2(2n+1)=m^2$ for some positive integer $m$, then $2n+1$ must be an odd perfect square. $2n+1=1^2$ gives $n=0$, which we reject because our integers are positive. $2n+1=3^2$ gives $n=4$, which yields a sum of $8\\times4+4=36$. Thus, the least possible sum is $\\boxed{36}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's denote the four consecutive positive even integers as n, n+2, n+4, and n+6. The sum of these four integers can be written as 4n + 12.\n\nThe sum is given to be a perfect square.

Thus, the number (m^2 - 12) must be divisible by 4, meaning it must be an even perfect square.\n\nLooking at the sequence of perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, ... we see that 16 is the first perfect square. \n\nHence let's plug m^2=16 into the equation to solve for n:\n\nn = (16 - 12) / 4 = 1.\n\nSo the four consecutive integers are 1*2=2, 3*2=6(2+4), 5*2=10(2+6), 7*2=14(2+8).\n\nThen, it's got to compute the sum going  back to the original problem, which say sum of four consecutive positive even integers is a perfect square.\n\nThus, the sum is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.

There was a logical error in considering the four consecutive even integers for which their sum is the least perfect square.\n\nIn my original solution, I started with the wrong equation:\n\n4n + 12 = m^2 \n\nThis equates to a perfect square (m^2), but this does not give us a sum that is itself a perfect square, leading us to the wrong number. \n\nInstead, the equation we should set to a perfect square is 2n + 6 = m^2, with n an integer, to solve for the smallest sum of four consecutive positive integers that is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, let's start by writing out the four consecutive even numbers in terms of n: 2n, 2n+2, 2n+4, and 2n+6. The sum of these numbers (which we'll denote as S) is: \n\nS = 2n + (2n+2) + (2n+4) + (2n+6) = 8n + 12.\n\nThen, let's try small values of the perfect square m^2 for the sum S:\n\nFor m^2 = 4, 8n + 12 = 4 or 8n = -8, we get a negative value for n which is invalid.\n\nFor m^2 = 9, 8n + 12 = 9 or 8n = -3, we still get a negative value for n.\n\nFor m^2 = 16, 8n + 12 = 16 or 8n = 4, we also get n as non-integer, which is also invalid.\n\nWhen we substitute m^2 = 36, and solving 8n + 12 = 36, simplifying it to 8n = 24, we get n = 3.\n\nSo the four consecutive positive even integers are: 2n=6, 2n+2=8, 2n+4=10, 2n+6=12, and their sum is 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 36 which is a perfect square, the least perfect square as the sum of four consecutive even integers.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be \\boxed{36}.", "round 2": "After reviewing all the solutions including mine, the correct approach can be summed up in the following steps:\n\n1.

Let the first of the four consecutive even numbers be denoted by 'a'. Then the next three numbers are represented as 'a + 2', 'a + 4', 'a + 6'.\n\n2.
