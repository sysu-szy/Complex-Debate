According to the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\nWe can determine if a year is a leap year with the following simple arithmetic: \nIf the year number is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400, then we can say that the year is a leap year.\n\nApplying this rule to 2008: \n2008 divided by 4 gives 502 meaning that 2008 is indeed a leap year because there are no remainders.\n\nRound 2: Determine how many days are in February during a leap year.\n\nSince we've confirmed that 2008 is a leap year, we know that February has 29 days instead of the usual 28. \n\nRound 3: Find the last Friday of February 2008.\n\nWe know that February 1, 2008, is a Friday which is the onset.
