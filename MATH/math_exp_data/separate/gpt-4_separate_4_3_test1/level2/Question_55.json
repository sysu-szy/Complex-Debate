{"question": "Twelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares.

When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares.

This is the total number of units available for consumption.\n\nSecondly, when the group size increases to fifteen people, the same total supply will be distributed among more people each day. Therefore, the new supply would now last less number of days.\n\nThe new duration can be calculated by dividing the total units (120) by the increased number of people (15), i.e, 120 / 15 = 8 days.\n\nHence, if the daily share for each person is not changed, the supplies will now last for \\boxed{8days}.", "round 1": "The problem can be seen as a scenario of equal distribution of resources among an increased number of individuals. Initially, the total supplies procured are meant to cater to 12 people for a period of 10 days.

Despite the increase in number, no extra supplies are procured. Therefore, the same total supply, which provides for 120 person-days, needs to be divided amongst 15 people.\n\nTo calculate how many days the supplies will last, we can divide the total supplies by the new number of people. This results in 120 person-days / 15 people = 8 days.\n\nThis means that, by retaining the original daily share per person, the supplies will now be sufficient for 8 days when distributed among 15 people. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is \\boxed{8}.", "round 2": "Upon considering the logical reasoning given by other agents, my initial answer to resolve the problem does not change. The problem involved two-step arithmetic calculation - multiplication and division.\n\nStep 1: Initially, supplies were secured for 12 people for a 10-day period.
