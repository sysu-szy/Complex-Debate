Therefore, we are looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $18$ and $24$.

Our original solution is mainly grounded on the prime factorization method, but we shall also explore the latter of the two methods in order to further enrich our solution.\n\nIn the prime factorization method: 18 was broken down to its prime factors of 2 and 3^2, and 24 was broken down into its prime factors of 2^3 and 3. The GCD then results as the product of the lowest common powers of these prime factors, which is 2^1*3^1 = 6.\n\nThe second technique, known as the Euclidean algorithm, involves repetitively dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. In this approach, 24 is divided by 18 to get a remainder of 6; after that, 18 is divided by this remainder (6) to get a remainder of zero.
