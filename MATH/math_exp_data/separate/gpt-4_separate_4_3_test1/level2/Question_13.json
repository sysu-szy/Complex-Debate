Given their definition, the line through these midpoints ($\\overline{AB}$) thus halves the height of the larger triangle $\\triangle XYZ$. It also halves the base of the triangle because $A$ and $B$ are midpoints.

This is because the midpoints of a triangle's sides, when connected, create a parallelogram which in this case is also a rectangle due to the right angles at $X$.\n\nAlso, note that since ${XC}$ bisects ${YZ}$, triangles $YCX$ and $ZCX$ are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side), because $XY = XZ$, $YC = ZC$ and angle $YCX = ZCX$. \n\nHence, the area of triangle XYZ is twice the area of triangle $XCY$. Given that the area of triangle $XYZ$ is $8$ square inches, the area of triangle $CXZ$ (and $CYZ$) is $4$ square inches.\n\nMoving on,  since $AB$ is a line segment formed by connecting two midpoints in a triangle, it's half the length of the base $YZ$. In triangle $XYZ$, the ratio of the height to base is $2:1$ (since the area of $XYZ$ is $8$ and $Area = 0.5 * base * height$), so the height of triangle $BXC$ is half that of $ XYZ $. \n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $BXC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} * 4 = 0.5$ square inches.\n\nFinally, since quadrilateral $XABC$ is rectangle, the area of the shaded area which is trapezoid $XBCA$ can be obtained by subtracting the area of triangle $BXC$ from the area of rectangle $XABC$.

Thus their individual areas are each 8/2 = 4 square inches.\n\n$AB$ has half the length of $YZ$ and height $XC$ is the altitude of triangle $XAB$, which bisects the altitude of triangle $XYZ$. Since the base and height of triangle $XAB$ are half of triangle $XYZ$, the area of triangle $XAB$ is 1/4 times the area of triangle $XYZ$. Hence, the area of triangle $XAB$ is 1/4 * 8 = 2 square inches.\n\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $YZ$ and is half its length, triangle $ABZ$ is similar to $ZXY$ with a scale factor of 1/2.

Now, each of the shaded regions is half of each half of triangle $XAB$.
