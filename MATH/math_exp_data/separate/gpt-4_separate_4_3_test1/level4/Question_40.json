The CRT states that if you have a system of congruences where all the moduli are pairwise coprime (in this case, 6 and 8 are not), you should first express the system in equivalent forms where the moduli are pairwise coprime.\n\nLet's revise our problem for this condition as follows:\nWe know $N \\equiv 5 \\bmod 8$ and $N \\equiv 3 \\bmod 6$.
