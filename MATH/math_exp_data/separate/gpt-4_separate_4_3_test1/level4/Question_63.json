{"question": "If $x$ is an integer and $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=292$, find $x$.", "answer": "We could subtract $292$ to the other side and try to solve the sixth-degree equation, but that would be ugly and we have no guarantee that it would even work. We notice that we can add a $x^4-x^4 + x^2 - x^2$ to the polynomial without changing its value: $$x^6-2x^5+(x^4-x^4)+2x^3+(x^2-x^2)-2x+1=292.$$ We regroup the terms and factor the left side, leaving the $292$ alone. \\begin{align*}\n(x^6-2x^5+x^4)+(-x^4+2x^3+-x^2)+(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\nx^4(x^2-2x+1)-x^2(x^2-2x+1)+1(x^2-2x+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^2-2x+1)(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x-1)^2(x^4-x^2+1)&=292.\n\\end{align*} To see a different way of obtaining this factorization, we could also group the $x^6$ and $1$ terms together and factor, giving: \\begin{align*}\n(x^6+1)+(-2x^5+2x^3-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^2+1)(x^4-x^2+1)-2x(x^4-x^2+1)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x^2+1-2x)&=292\\\\\n(x^4-x^2+1)(x-1)^2&=292.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is an integer, then $x^4-x^2+1$ and $x-1$ are integers, so they must be factors of $292$. The prime factorization of $292$ is $2^2\\cdot 73$. The value $(x-1)^2$ must be a square which divides $292$, and we can see that the only squares which divide $292$ are $1$ and $4$.\n\nIf $(x-1)^2=1$, then $x-1=\\pm 1$, and $x=2$ or $x=0$. If $x=0$, it's easy to see from the original equation that it won't work, since the left side of the original equation would be $1$ while the right side would be $292$. If $x=2$, then the left side would equal $(2^4-2^2+1)(2-1)^2=(16-4+1)(1)^2=13\\neq 292$. So both values of $x$ are impossible.\n\nThus $(x-1)^2=4$, so $x-1=\\pm 2$ and $x=3$ or $x=-1$. If $x=-1$, then we have the left side as $((-1)^4-(-1)^2+1)((-1)-1)^2=(1-1+1)(-2)^2=1(4)=4\\neq 292$. If $x=3$, then we have $(3^4-3^2+1)(3-1)^2=(81-9+1)(2^2)=73\\cdot2^2=292$ as desired. Thus the only possibility for $x$ is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Firstly, let's rewrite the equation in a way that will be more helpful for us to solve it. Notice that all terms in the equation have $x$ raised to an odd power except for $x^6$, which is $x$ to an even power, and the constant 292. This suggests that the substitution $y = x^3$ might simplify the equation. So, if $y = x^3$, then $x^6 = y^2$ and $x^5 = yx^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation gives $(x^3)^2- 2(x^3)x^2 + 2x^3 - 2x + 1 = 292$, or $y^2 - 2yx^2 + 2y - 2x + 1 = 292$. Now, let's collect all terms to one side: $y^2 - 2yx^2 + 2y - 2x + 293 = 0$.\n\nHowever, we know $y = x^3$. Substituting this back into the equation, we get $(x^3)^2 - 2(x^3)x^2 + 2(x^3) - 2x + 293 = 0$. Simplifying, we obtain $x^6 - 2x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x + 293 = 0$.\n\nAs you can see, our equation is a polynomial equation of degree 6, which is in general not easy to solve directly. However, we can try solving the equation for $x$ by looking for integer roots through the Rational Root Theorem, which says that if a polynomial has a rational root $\\frac{p}{q}$, then $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. Here the constant term is 293 and coefficient of $x^6$ is 1. Because 293 is a prime number, the only integer solutions can be $\\pm1, \\pm293$.\n\nPlug these four integers into the equation, we can easily find the solution is $x = -1$.

However, I think some of them have made an error or applied the wrong approach. \n\nAgent 0 incorrectly deduced that the solutions are 3 and -3. This can be disproved by simply substituting these values into the equation, which will show they don't satisfy the equation. \n\nAgent 1 correctly notes that the number of real roots of the polynomial is even, but makes a mistake in evaluation for x=3. The correct evaluation should be $3^6 - 2*3^5 + 2*3^3 - 2*3 - 291 = 729 - 486 + 54 - 6 - 291 = 0$, which doesn't hold true.\n\nAgent 2 takes an imaginative approach, attempting to relate the equation to the binomial theorem. However, this approach is flawed from the start because it exploits the symmetry in the coefficients of the equation, which isn't applicable in this situation as the missing $x^4$ and $x^2$ terms have no way to be added in without changing the structure and solutions of the equation fundamentally.\n\nReturning to the initial analysis of the equation in the earlier round, since the power of the equation is 6 and it is given that $x$ is an integer, we could carry out a simple brute force check for values from $x=1$ to $x=6$, and $x=-1$ to $x=-6$, we would find that on substituting $x=-1$, we get $x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x+1=(-1)^6-2(-1)^5+2(-1)^3 -2(-1) +1 = 1+2-2+2+1=4$, which is not equal to 292.\n\nIt seems that an error occurred during the calculation in the last round. Upon checking again we find that when we substitute $x=-1$ in the original equation, it equates to $(-1)^6 - 2(-1)^5 + 2(-1)^3 - 2(-1) + 1 = 1+2+2+2+1=8$, not 4 and 8 subtracted from 292 equals $284$, not 0.\n\nThe solution from the last round which found $x=-1$ as a solution seems to be incorrect after all.\n\nSo, we will resort back to the standard way of attacking this problem using Rational Root Theorem. Looking for integer solutions of this polynomial where the constant term is $293 - 292 = 1$ and the coefficient of the highest degree term, $x^6$, is 1. Our potential rational roots are $\\pm1$.\n\nOnce we substitute $x=1$ into the equation we obtain $1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 1 = 0$ which doesn't hold true to our equation equal to $292$.\n\nHowever, substituting $x=-1$ into the equation, we get $(-1)^6 - 2(-1)^5 + 2(-1)^3 - 2(-1) + 1 = 1 + 2 - 2 + 2 + 1 = 4$. Apparently, subtracting $292$ from both sides of the equation, we find that $4 - 292 = -288 \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution for the integer $x$ that will satisfy the given equation.\n\nSo, the updated correct answer is \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.", "round 2": "After reading all the explanations from other agents, each of the agents made different interpretations and due to some misconceptions, their answers resulted in different solutions.

However, we have additional information that x is an integer. Therefore, we can use some heuristics as well as trial and error to solve this problem.\n\nIn this equation, the highest power of x is 6, thus the magnitude of the integer x is more likely to be relatively small. \n\nMoreover, since we are dealing with an equation where only even powers of x have coefficients other than 1, we know that whether x is positive or negative will not affect the outcome of the equation, due to the properties of even powers. \n\nThis suggests that we can solve looking for a positive integer solution, and then the opposite negative integer will also be a solution if one exists.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides to isolate the terms with variables, our equation becomes:\n\n$x^6-2x^5+2x^3-2x=291$\n\nThis suggests trial and error, substituting small positive integers for x.

It states that the rational root of a polynomial must be a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. The constant term in our equation is 291 and the leading coefficient is 1 (in front of $x^6$). Hence, all possible integer solutions of the polynomial are the divisors of 291.\n\n291 is odd and it's not divisible by 3, so it's only possible divisors could be 1, 291 and some prime numbers larger than 3 and less than the square-root of 291. Although this fact could reduce the guess work, it still does not provide a direct method to find the solution.\n\nReflecting on the solutions offered by the others and our own approach, the best way to handle this equation remains plugging in small integer values for x until we find the one that satisfies our equation, due to the nature of the problem. An attempt to manipulate the equation into a more familiar form, as suggested by Agent Solution 2, is severely complicated by the fact that the coefficients 292, 1 and -2 don't lend themselves nicely to an obvious binomial pair.\n\nHence, after a careful reevaluation of our solution, we find that the answer remains the same.

As the equation is with real coefficients any nonreal roots must be conjugates, in pairs. If r + si is a root then r - si is also a root. This implies that the number of the real roots is even, because the total number of roots is 6. Hence, the number of real roots is 2 or 4 or 6.\n\nHowever, this does not tell us exactly the value of x that satisfies the initial equation. It would be immensely difficult to solve it directly. Hence, we need another approach. \n\nGiven the statement that x is an integer, examining the size of the coefficients it seems like x is quite small. For fair-sized $x$, $x^6$ will easily dominate $-2x^5$, making the other terms negligible.
