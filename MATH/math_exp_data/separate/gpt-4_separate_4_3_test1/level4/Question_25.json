Thus we can rewrite the formula:\n\n\\[|z_{n+1}| = \\left|\\frac{i z_n}{\\overline{z}_n}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{i z_n}{|z_n|}\\right| = |i| = 1\\]\n\nThis tells us that each $z_n$ in the sequence has the same magnitude, that is $|z_0| = |z_1| = |z_2| = ... = 1$.\n\nRound 2: The Argument of $z_{n+1}$\n\nWe can also look at the argument of each $z_n$ (also known as its phase or argument). The argument of a complex number measures the angle it makes with the positive real axis, and it changes when we multiply the number by $i$. In particular, multiplying by $i$ rotates the complex number 90 degrees counterclockwise on the complex plane.

For each possible rotation that results in an argument of a complex number with modulus 1 equal to the argument of $1$, there's a unique corresponding $z_0$ value at 90 degree-oriented intervals. The number of intervals in 2005 steps is $2005/4 = 501.25$, which does not form a complete rotation of 360 degrees, so we count 501 complete cycles. Thus there are 501 different possible values of $z_0$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{501}", "round 1": "Upon reviewing the solutions provided by the other agents, some inconsistencies become apparent. Notably, the solutions provided differ widely in numeric values, indicating an error in some throughprocesses. Let's take a closer look at the problem and reconcile the solutions outlined.\n\nRecall that the problem is rooted in the concept of complex number rotation on the complex plane. A complex number $z = a + bi$ can be represented as $re^{i\\theta}$, where $r$ is the magnitude and $\\theta$ is the angle or argument. In the problem, the magnitude of every complex number in the sequence is given to be 1, meaning each lies on the unit circle. \n\nMathematically, multiplication by $i$ corresponds to a rotation of 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. Therefore, the recursion $z_{n+1}=\\frac{\\ iz_n\\ }{\\overline{z}_n}$, results in a 90\u00b0 rotation of the sequence. \n\nGiven that $z_{2005} = 1$, it means that after 2005 steps of rotation, the sequence has landed on the positive $x$-axis. This only happens if the cumulative rotation was a multiple of 360\u00b0 (i.e., full circles). We know that each step corresponds to a 90\u00b0 rotation, so after 2005 steps we've covered 2005 * 90\u00b0 = 180225\u00b0.\n\nTo find out how many full circles this equates to, we divide by 360\u00b0. This means that the sequence would complete 180225/360 = 500.625 full circles. However, only whole number of circles brings us back to the positive x-axis. Therefore, it has completed 500 full circles.\n\nThis means that there are 500 multiples of 90\u00b0, which can be related to the 4 quadrants of the plane. As such, we must multiply 500 by 4 to find out all possible starting points for $z_0$ (for each quadrant). Hence, there are 500 * 4 = 2000 possible values for $z_0$.\n\nAlready we can see this does not align with the solutions provided. Upon further analysis, it appears that some of the other solutions inaccurately calculated the number of 90\u00b0 rotations in 2005 steps, while others looked at other aspects like changes of the angle throughout the process.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of possible values for $z_0$ is \\boxed{2000}.", "round 2": "There appears to be a misunderstanding or confusion arising from the interpretation of rotation and reflection in the complex plane among the solutions proposed.\n\nIndeed, the given operation $z \\to \\frac{i z}{\\overline{z}}$ is equivalent to a reflection of a complex number about the imaginary axis which is then followed by a rotation of 90 degrees anti-clockwise. As such, each application of the recurrence corresponds to a net rotation of 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nHowever, the above interpretations seem to commit errors in calculating the number of 90\u00b0 rotations needed to land back on the positive x-axis. Let's resolve these discrepancies.\n\nFirstly, we note that for the sequence to land back on the positive x-axis, the collective rotation performed must be a multiple of a full circle, which is 360\u00b0. \n\nThe recurrence relation $z_{n+1} = \\frac{i z_n}{\\overline{z_n}}$ corresponds to a rotation of 90\u00b0 anti-clockwise, so after 2005 steps, we would have completed 2005 * 90\u00b0 = 180225\u00b0.\n\nTo find the number of full circles this corresponds to, we divide this amount by a full circle, which is 360\u00b0. Here, we find that 180225/360 = 500.625 full circles. However, notice that this isn't a whole number and thus we cannot land exactly on the x-axis. The actual number of complete circles we finish is just the integer part, 500 circles. \n\nSince each complete circle covers 4 quadrants, each of the 500 can start in any of the 4 quadrants, hence multiplying by 4 gives us the total of 2000 starting points. \n\nTherefore, the correct number of possible values for $z_0$ is \\boxed{2000}.

My initial instinct to consider the sequence as rotations on the unit circle in the complex plane seems to be agreed upon by the other agents.

The given operation $z \\to \\frac{i z}{\\overline{z}}$ corresponds to a reflection of a complex number about the imaginary axis which is then followed by a rotation of 90 degrees anti-clockwise. However, as I initially indicated, $z_{n+1} = \\frac{i z_{n}}{\\overline{z_{n}}}$ is equivalent to a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ clockwise. \n\nAgent1's comment supports mine. However, they made the mistake of arguing that we need to start at a multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ in order to reach a full rotation of $2\\pi$ after 2005 steps. This argument is incorrect because they are assuming that the rotation at each step may be by a multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$; however, the rotation at each step is by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is equivalent to a rotation by $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ modulo $2\\pi$, or a rotation by $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ in the other direction.\n\nTo support Agent2's observation that the transformation actually corresponds to rotation of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ counter-clockwise, recall that multiplication by $i$ is equivalent to a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ counter-clockwise, and that taking the reciprocal (because $|z_n|=1$ for all $n$, we can take the reciprocal without changing the modulus) is equivalent to a reflection in the real axis. Performing the reflection followed by the rotation gives us a net rotation of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ clockwise.\n\nLooking at the final step, because $z_{2005}=1,$ and given that each step corresponds to a $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ clockwise rotation, there are 2005 possible starting points. A complete rotation of the complex plane is made each 4 steps, which corresponds to the 4 distinct $2005^{th}$ roots of unity, however, you have to consider that each rotation is concatenated 2005 times.

The net effect of these operations is a rotation of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (or $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$) clockwise.\n\nSo, we have a rotation of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ at each step. From there, we need to compute how many full rotations are made after 2005 steps. \n\nSince a full rotation is $2\\pi$ radians (or 360 degrees), we can calculate the net rotation after 2005 steps by multiplying the number of steps by the magnitude of each rotation:\n$2005 * -\\frac{\\pi}{2} = -1002.5\\pi$. \n\nHowever, since we are always rotating clockwise, we can express this as a positive angle by adding multiples of $2\\pi$ until we get a positive result: $-1002.5\\pi + 1003*2\\pi = 2003.5\\pi$.\n\nGiven that a full rotation is $2\\pi$, the next step is to determine how many full rotations are made in total. Since the net rotation is $2003.5\\pi$, this corresponds to $2003.5 = 1001.75$ full rotations.\n\nThis means that within 2005 steps, we returned to the starting position $1001.75$ times. However, these rotations need to be in full semicircles, because we always land on the real line (either at 1 or -1). Half-rotations, in this case, do not count as full rotations.\n\nThus, the last term $z_{2005} = 1$ tells us that we must also add another half rotation. So in total, we made $1001.75 + 0.5 = 1002.25$ full rotations.\n\nNow, given that each full rotation corresponds to the four quadrantal angles, each of which brings us back to the positive real axis (the place where $z_{2005}$ lies), we must multiply the total number of full rotations by 4.\n\nHence, the total number of possible starting values for $z_0$ is $1002.25 * 4 = 4009$.\n\nHowever, the number of possible values should be an integer. Because we've obtained 4009 as a decimal, this suggests a computation error. Given that every step is a rotation of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ clockwise and $z_{2005}$ ends up on the positive x-axis (at angle 0), the original angle of $z_0$ should be divisible by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. \n\nThus, I made the error in computation by using the final rotation to be $-1002.5\\pi$ and thus wrongly adding $2\\pi$ rotations. Instead, it should be computed in this way: for $z_{2005}$ to be 1, the rotation would need to encompass 2005 $90^\\circ$ quarter turns, which would be $2005 / 4 = 501.25$ full turns. However, the 0.25 turn will not reach $z_{2005} = 1$, but will rather be perpendicular to it.\n\nThat means there have been 501 full turns (2004 quarter turns) and an extra full turn (4 quarter turns) from $z_0$ to be able to reach $z_{2005} = 1$.\n\nThese full turns (360 degrees each) are equal to 4 possible start points for $z_0$ (since start points need to be divisible by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$). As such,\n\n$501 \\times 4 = 2004$\n\nAs we added one full turn (4 quarter turns), we add 4 to our number of possible $z_0$.\n\n$2004 + 4 = 2008$\n\nIn conclusion, carefully considering the scenario, there are \\boxed{2008} possible values of $z_0$.\n"}, {"round 0": "First, note that the magnitude of every $z_n$ is 1 because: \n\n\\[\n|z_{n+1}| = \\left|\\frac{i z_n}{\\overline{z}_n}\\right|\n= \\left|\\frac{iz_n}{|z_n|^2 }\\right|\n= \\left|\\frac{i}{\\overline{z}_n }\\right|\n= 1.\n\\]\nThis is due to the property of the complex conjugate that $z \\overline{z} = |z|^2$.\n\nLet's split $z_n$ into its real and imaginary components: $z_n = x_n + iy_n$.

However, since we have a fraction with the complex conjugate of $z_n$ in the denominator, this correlates to a reflection across the imaginary axis before the multiplication by $i$. As a result, each application of the recurrence relation represents a reflection across the imaginary axis followed by a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise. Combined, this operation equates to a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation, or rotation by $\\pi$ radians about the origin.\n\nGiven $z_{2005} = 1$, this means after 2005 iterations, we land on the positive real axis, which is angle $0^{\\circ}$ or $0$ rad.

Therefore, there are $2^{2005}-2^{2004}+1=2^{2004}+1$ possible values for $k$.\n\nSo, the number of possible values for $z_0$ is \\boxed{2^{2004}+1}."}]}
