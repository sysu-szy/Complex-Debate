Also, if we try to have b equal to 9 the largest possible value, that leaves us with P equal to 8. But, $8*8 = 64$ in base-10 which would mean we would have carryovers in base-9.\n\n2. Seeing that the multiplication of two identical numbers yields a two-digit result of 31b which is equivalent to $3*b + 1$ in base 10, P must be 3. This is because the multiplication of two numbers P and b should result in a figure ending with b-base digit 1, and only by making use of P = 3 can this be fulfilled.\n\n3.
