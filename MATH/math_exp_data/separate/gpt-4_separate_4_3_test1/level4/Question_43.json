Since it is a perfect square, its degree must be even. Thus, the polynomial inside the square root must have an even degree. To satisfy this condition, $a$ and $c$ should be an even integer.\n\nRound 2: Furthermore, for the polynomial to be a perfect square, the coefficients should satisfy the following property. The square root of the product of the coefficients of the constant term and the leading coefficient must be equal to the coefficient of the middle term. Applying this property to our polynomial, we have $\\sqrt{ac} = b$.\n\nRound 3:  Moving on to the second polynomial, it is also a perfect square. So again, the polynomial inside the square root has to be an even degree. But now, $2a$ and $2c$ need to be even integers. Since $a$ and $c$ were already established as even integers, we don't have a contradiction here.\n\nRound 4: Applying the property of perfect square to the second polynomial, we have $\\sqrt{2^2 ac} = 2b$. Simplifying, there is $2\\sqrt{ac} = 2b$. Since we already have $\\sqrt{ac} = b$, this equation holds true.\n\nHence, $a$ and $c$ are even, and that $\\sqrt{ac} = b$ holds true for both given polynomials.\n\nRound 5: However, the problem did not specify integral values for $a, b, c$, they are positive real numbers. Hence, they don't need to be integers (odd or even), they only need to satisfy the equation $\\sqrt{ac} = b$.\n\nRound 6: To find $a+b+c$, we use the equation $\\sqrt{ac} = b$. We can rewrite this equation in the following way: $b^2 = ac$. Substituting $b^2$ for $ac$ in the expression for $a+b+c$ gives us $a + \\sqrt{ac} + c = a + b + c$, which simplifies to $b + b + c$. That gives us $2b+c$, but we know that $b = \\sqrt{ac}$, so, substituting  back, we get double of that, which is $2\\sqrt{ac} + c$. Since $c$ is also $\\sqrt{ac}$ by rearranging the previous equation.\n\nRound 7: Hence, $a+b+c = 2\\sqrt{ac} + \\sqrt{ac} = 3\\sqrt{ac}$. Now, taking the original equation and equating it to the square root of the second polynomial, we have:$x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = (x^2+ dx+1)^2$, where $d=2a,b,c$, respectively and so from here $b= 2d+d$.\n\nTherefore, final value of $a + b + c =  2(2d+d) + 2d = 6d$.
