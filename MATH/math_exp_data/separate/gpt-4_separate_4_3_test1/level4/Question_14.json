This means that the function p(x) needs to be represented in a form where we can substitute these given values of x and find the corresponding values of the function. \n\nRound 2: Representing the function\n\nA quadratic function with rational coefficients can be represented as `p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c` where a, b, and c are rational numbers. However, also keeping in mind that square roots of non-perfect square numbers are irrational, p(x) will be a quadratic in terms of $sqrt(x)$. Therefore, let's represent `p(x)` as `p(x) = a*sqrt(x)\u00b2 + b*sqrt(x) + c`.\n\nBut, the above equation simplifies to `p(x) = ax + b*sqrt(x) + c`.\n\nRound 3: Getting equations for a, b, and c\n\nWe are given two points on the function: \n(sqrt(7), 22),\n(sqrt(11), 30).\n\nSubstituting these points respectively in the equation we get:\n\ni) 7a + b*sqrt(7) + c = 22\nii) 11a + b*sqrt(11) + c = 30\n\nRound 4: Solving the equations\n\nSolving equations [i] and [ii] using substitution or elimination methods to get values for a, b, and c is very complex due to the square roots. One simple way to solve this kind of problem is to use Vieta's Relations which suggests that the numbers sqrt(7) and sqrt(11) are the roots of the equation p(x) = 0.\n\nAccording to Vieta's relations:\n\nThe sum of the roots -b/a = sqrt(7) + sqrt(11) and \nThe product of the roots c/a = sqrt(7)*sqrt(11)\n\nHowever, we can't find a, b, and c using the above method as we have only two variables and three unknowns. Therefore, we have to find another equation.

But notice that through a simple substitution, sqrt(17) = sqrt(7) + sqrt(10), we can express p(sqrt(17)) in terms of sqrt(7), and sqrt(10) which is also sqrt(11 - 1) = sqrt(11) - sqrt(1), and then plug into our first two equations.\n\nRound 5: Substitution and Simplification\n\np(sqrt(17)) = p(sqrt(7+10)) is the same as p(sqrt(7) + sqrt(10))\n\nExpanding this results in,\n\np(sqrt(17))= p(sqrt(7)) + 10a + p(sqrt(11)) - a\n\nSubstituting the given values, we find,\n\np(sqrt(17))= 22 + 10 - 30 + 30\n\n= \\boxed{42}.\n\nRound 6: Conclusion\n\nSo, the p(sqrt(17)) equals 42 when p(x) is a quadratic with rational coefficients and p(sqrt(7)) = 22 and p(sqrt(11)) = 30.", "round 1": "Round 1: Understanding the problem\n\nThe problem gives us a quadratic polynomial p(x) with rational coefficients and informs us that p(sqrt(7)) = 22 and p(sqrt(11)) = 30.

We are given that p(sqrt(7)) = 22 and p(sqrt(11)) = 30. These two points define our polynomial.

Since this polynomial is quadratic, we have to modify the equation slightly to get it into a suitable form:\n\np(x) = a(x - sqrt7)(x - sqrt11) + b(x) + c\n\nThis form comes from the observation that if sqrt(7) and sqrt(11) are roots, the polynomial is expressed as p(x) = a(x - sqrt(7))(x - sqrt(11)) for some rational number \"a\". \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite p(sqrt(17)) as:\n\np(sqrt(17)) = p(sqrt(7) + sqrt(11) - sqrt(1))\n           = a(2*sqrt(7) + sqrt(11))(sqrt(11) - sqrt(7)) + b(sqrt(7) + sqrt(11)) + c\n\nAt this point we can substitute the given values p(sqrt(7)) = 22 and p(sqrt(11)) = 30 into the equation:\n\np(sqrt(17)) = a(2* 22 + 30)(30 - 22) + b( 22 + 30) + c\n\nRound 5: Expanding and Simplifying\n       \nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\np(sqrt(17)) = a(44 + 30)(30 - 22) + b(52) + c\n= a(74)(8) + 52b + c\n= 592a + 52b + c\n\nWe know that p(sqrt(7)) = 22, so we can substitute a = 22 into the equation:\n\np(sqrt(17)) = 592 * 22 + 52 * 30 + c\n= 13024 + 1560 + c\n= 14584 + c\n\nWe also know that p(sqrt(11)) = 30, so we substitute b = 30 into the equation:\n\np(sqrt(17)) = 14584 + 30\n= 14614\n\nSo \\boxed{p(\\sqrt{17}) = 14614}.

The agent ignores the inherent structure of a quadratic polynomial and misuses the additivity property of polynomials.

After finding $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can substitute $x = \\sqrt{17}$ into our polynomial to find $p(\\sqrt{17})$. This involves more tedious computations and careful manipulations.\n\nActually, there is no need to do the above computations. The problem can be solved more smartly. The procedure is called Polynomial Interpolation, specifically, quadratic interpolation. \n\nHere it is:\n\nBecause $p(x)$ is a quadratic, we know that $p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ for some rational $a$, $b$, and $c$.

Recognizing the left-hand side as a difference of squares (and using the quadratic formula), we obtain $a=2$. Substituting this into the equation $a\\sqrt[4]{7^3}+b\\sqrt{7}+c=22$, we obtain $b=3$, and substituting this into the equation $b^2=30$ gives $c=1$.\n\nTherefore, we have $p(x)=2x^2+3x+1$, and plugging in $\\sqrt{17}$ and simplifying gives $p(\\sqrt{17})=2\\cdot17+3\\sqrt{17}+1=\\boxed{41}$."}, {"round 0": "Round 1:\n\nGiven that $p(x)$ is a quadratic, we can write $p(x)$ as $ax^2 + bx + c$ for some constants $a$, $b$ and $c$.\n\nWe know that $p(\\sqrt{7}) = 22$, which results in $7a + b\\sqrt{7} + c = 22$. \n\nSimilarly, from the condition $p(\\sqrt{11}) = 30$, we have $11a + b\\sqrt{11} + c = 30$.\n\nLet's call these two equations (1) and (2), respectively.\n\nRound 2:\n\nWe are supposed to find $p(\\sqrt{17})$, which is $17a + b\\sqrt{17} + c$ in quadratic form.\n\nWe can generate another equation out of (1) and (2), by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2).

Plugging in $x = \\sqrt{17}$, we find that $p(\\sqrt{17}) = -\\frac{22}{\\sqrt{7}-\\sqrt{11}}(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{11})$.\n\nSimplifying this expression gives $p(\\sqrt{17}) = -\\frac{22(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{11})}{\\sqrt{7}-\\sqrt{11}}$.\n\nThis is our final answer. We have\n\n\\boxed{p(\\sqrt{17}) = -\\frac{22(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{11})}{\\sqrt{7}-\\sqrt{11}}}.", "round 1": "Let us examine the previous solutions and narrow down the possible approaches. The critical observation in this problem, made by me in the previous round, is that the value of a quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ at any point $x$ can be determined from its values at any other two points.\n\nGiven that $p$ is a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients, it follows that $p(x) can be expressed in the form $p(x) = a(x - \\sqrt{7})(x - \\sqrt{11}) + d$ for some rational numbers $a$ and $d$.\n\nFrom the given information, $p(\\sqrt{7}) = 22$ and $p(\\sqrt{11}) = 30$. Therefore, we must solve the following system of equations to find $a$ and $d$:\n\n\\[\\begin{cases}\na (\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{11}) + d = 22, \\\\\na (\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{11}) + d = 30.\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, $d = 22$ because $\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{7}$ annihilates the $a$ term.\n\nSubstituting $d = 22$ into the second equation gives us $a (\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7}) = 8$, or $a = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\nTherefore, we can write $p(x) = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7}}(x - \\sqrt{7})(x - \\sqrt{11}) + 22$.\n\nFinally, we can compute $p(\\sqrt{17})$:\n\n$$p(\\sqrt{17}) = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{11} - \\sqrt{7}}(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{11}) + 22$$\n\nIn order to simplify this expression, we will need to rationalize the denominator of the first term by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{7}$:\n\n$$p(\\sqrt{17}) = \\frac{8(\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{11})}{4} + 22$$\n\nCancel the $8$ with the $4$ in the denominator, and notice that the terms in the numerator form a chain of differences of squares, which allows us to simplify the entire expression dramatically: \n\n$$p(\\sqrt{17}) = 2((\\sqrt{187} - 4)(\\sqrt{280} - 4)) + 22 = \\boxed{370}.$$\n\nI can thus conclude with confidence that the solution of the given problem is $p(\\sqrt{17}) = \\boxed{370},$ which considerably simplifies the results of my previous analysis.", "round 2": "The reasoning in my original solution seems to be correct.
