{"question": "Suppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books.

There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Firstly, consider these books as 5 objects to be arranged - the 4 non-math books and 1 unit of 2 math books.

We can consider the math books as distinct individual books rather than a unit. In each of the above 120 arrangements, there are 5 spaces where the math books could be inserted to ensure they are not next to each other, specifically before the first book, between the first and second book, between the second and third book, between the third and fourth book, and after the fourth book.\n\nFor any one arrangement of 5 objects, there are 5 selection choices for the first math book, and then 4 remaining selection choices for the second math book.
