{"question": "Josh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?", "answer": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Given:\nDistance between Josh and Mike = 13 miles\nJosh's time = 2*Mike's time\nJosh's speed = 4/5*Mike's speed\n\nWe'll use the distance formula that states: Distance = Speed * Time.\n\nLet's denote Mike's time as \"t\" (in hours), then Josh's time is twice that, or \"2t\".

Josh\u2019s speed is 4S/5 (since Josh is riding at four-fifths of Mike's rate), and Josh has ridden for 2T hours (since Josh has ridden for twice as long as Mike).\n\nThen, the distance each has ridden can be determined using the equation D = RT for both Josh and Mike.
