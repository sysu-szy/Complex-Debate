Remembering the nature of a parabola, we know that for any point P on the parabola, FP is perpendicular to the tangent line at P.\n\nFrom this knowledge, we can determine that segment AF is a tangent to the parabola at point A, and segment BF is a tangent at point B, as AF and BF are perpendicular to the tangent lines at A and B respectively.\n\nWe have a right triangle FAV (and FVB), where FV = FA (and FV = VB).
