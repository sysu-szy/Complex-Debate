Here's the correct rationale behind the solution:\n\nThe function is determined by the maximum of several different absolute values.

The minimum points of individual absolute value functions based on their input expressions occur at x = -15, -12, -8, 1, 3, and 19.

We acknowledged that the value of f(x) may change where two input expressions |a - b| and |c - d| intersect, however their endpoints // breakpoints would provide the lowest or highest values. The reason lies in the linear behavior of the absolute value functions in the intervals defined by the intersection points.\n\n4.

In this case, we have a set of points a= {-15, -12, -8, 1, 3, 19}. Each of these points is a vertex, and since we're looking for the minimum, we look between the vertices.\n\nTo find the minimum, we first plot the set of points for the values of $a$ within the absolute value and treat this as linear equations, effectively ignoring the absolute values for now.

This is because it's not necessarily guaranteed that the two absolute values will be equal at the same values of x. Instead, we need to consider when each absolute value function has a value of zero individually.\n\nSecondly, the minimum of a function comprised of absolute values will always be zero, as long as there is an x that makes any of the absolute value functions have a value of zero.

Absolute Value Equality:\n\nWhen two absolute value expressions are equated, we must remember that each absolute value can refer to two different x-values. For example, if we have |x + 15| = |x + 12|, this implies that either x + 15 = x + 12 or -(x + 15) = x + 12. Solving these two equations, it is clear that no real solution exists.
