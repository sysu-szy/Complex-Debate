Nevertheless, we shall transfer our abilities to utilize some basic properties of algebra instead.\n\nFirstly, we realize that the equation given is a quadratic equation. The roots of any quadratic equation in the general form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are usually found by applying Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. These formulas essentially follow from the process of \"unfoiling\" the equation $(x-r)(x-s)=0$ where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic.\n\nSince we know \"$3+\\sqrt{5}$\" is a root of the quadratic equation and we know that the coefficient of $x^2$ (that would be $a$ in general form) is 1, we can start by finding the sum of the roots. According to Vieta, this sum is equal to $-b/1$ or $-b$ (because $a = 1$ in this case).\n\nBut if \"$3+\\sqrt{5}$\" is one of the roots, what\u2019s the other one? We need another property to explain this. Every quadratic equation with rational coefficients that also has one irrational root, must have the irrational conjugate of that root as the other root of the equation. \n\nWhy so? Assume we have a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and it's known that at least one of the solutions is irrational. Then by the quadratic formula, both solutions must be in the form $x = [-b\u00b1sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a$. If $b^2-4ac<0$, then both solutions are complex (not irrational). If $b^2-4ac=0$, both solutions are rational (again, not unequal irrationals). The only remaining option is $b^2-4ac>0$, where we have two different roots, but these roots must be unequal conjugate irrationals. Because of that radical $\u00b1$ right there, if one is irrational, the other must be its conjugate.\n\nSo, from that property we know that if $3+\\sqrt{5}$ is one of the roots, the other root must be its conjugate, i.e., $3-\\sqrt{5}$. \n\nKnowing both roots, we can now apply Vieta's formulas.
