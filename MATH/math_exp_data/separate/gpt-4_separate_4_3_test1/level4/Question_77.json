Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "First, observe that since the parabola has a vertex at $(4, -5)$, it opens either upwards or downwards. Given the information that the parabola has two x-intercepts, one positive and one negative, this implies that the parabola must open upwards, otherwise it would not be possible for it to intersect the x-axis at two distinct points.\n   \nAn upward opening parabola is represented by a quadratic function in the form of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a > 0.$ Therefore, the coefficient $a$ must be positive.\n\nNext, if the vertex of the parabola is $(4, -5)$, then the graph of the function is a transformation of the graph of $y = ax^2$ by 4 units to the right and 5 units down. Since the y-coordinate of the vertex is negative, the y-intercept of the function, which is the value of $c$, must also be negative. Thus, $c$ must be negative.\n\nWe can't determine the sign of $b$ based solely on the given information. So, there's no guarantee that $b$ is positive.\n\nHence, the answer is just \\boxed{a}. This means only the coefficient $a$ must be positive for the problem's condition to be satisfied.", "round 1": "After analyzing the debate, there seem to be differing ideas among agents regarding the signs of the coefficients $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. However, let's review some fundamental concepts related to a parabola.\n\nThe first and foremost thing is that we have a parabola with a vertex of $(4,-5)$ and it has two x-intercepts. Given this, we know that the parabola opens upwards (since it crosses the x-axis and the vertex is below the x-axis). This leads to the conclusion that $a$ in $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ must be positive.\n\nThen, regarding the coefficient $c$, it corresponds to the y-intercept of the quadratic function. This, however, cannot be determined from just the given information about the parabola. One intuitive way might be that because the parabola's vertex is below the x-axis and it opens upwards, the y-intercept should be higher than the vertex and hence positive. But unfortunately, this particular argument is based on the particular x-intercepts and not universally applicable.\n\nLastly, the coefficient $b$ is dependent on both coefficients $a$ and $c$ and the vertex coordinates. Without more specific information about these factors, it isn't definitively ascertainable whether $b$ is positive or not.\n\nConsidering all discussed points from all agents, I would stay with my initial assessment after re-evaluating my logic. The answer is $\\boxed{a}$. This denotes only coefficient $a$ is inevitably positive as per the given conditions in the problem.", "round 2": "Analyzing everything, my initial answer remains the same.\n\nConsidering the fact that the parabola crosses the x-axis in two places one of which is in the negative x-territory and the other in the positive, and its vertex being $(4, -5)$, the parabola must open upwards. For this configuration to occur, the coefficient a has to be positive for sure. This implies that the parabola is a minimum. \n\nAbout coefficient c, however, it denotes the y-intercept (the value of y when x=0) of the function. As several agents argued, if one of the roots is negative and the other is positive, and provided that a is positive, the product of these roots yields a negative result, implying that c is negative.\n\nReferring to the coefficient b, it is dependent on the coefficients a and c as well as the vertex. Without more specific information about these values, it's not definitively possible to ascertain whether b is positive or negative.\n\nAfter careful examination, my final answer remains that only the coefficient $a$ must be positive based on the given conditions in the problem statement. So the answer is \\boxed{a}."}, {"round 0": "The key information we are given in this problem is the location of the vertex of the parabola and a hint of the shape of the parabola.\n\nLet's firstly consider the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola is y = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola. Since the vertex is given at (4, -5), we can say that h is positive and k is negative. But neither of these immediately indicates that one of the coefficients a, b, or c must be positive.\n\nSo let's move on to consider the x-intercepts. It is stated that the parabola has one x-intercept that is positive and one that is negative. Both of these x-intercepts will become roots in the equation a(x - r)(x - s) = 0, for two real numbers r and s where r \u2260 s and one of r or s is positive and the other negative, corresponding to our positive and negative x-intercepts. \n\nWhen expanded, this gives us the equation ax\u00b2 - a(r + s)x + ars = 0, which we can match with our standard form to say that c = ars (positive, since multiplied by a negative and positive), b = -a(r + s) (sign undetermined), and a = a (sign undetermined).\n\nNote that the given vertex (4, -5) is beneath the x-intercept. This means that the parabola opens upward. For that to happen, a must be positive. \n\nSummarizing, c must be positive (since it's the product of a positive and negative number) and the coefficient a must be positive (because the parabola opens upward).\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{a, c} must be positive.", "round 1": "After surveying the different solutions presented by the other agents, it's clear to me that my initial answer was correct: both a and c must be positive.\n\nLet's reason it again:\n\n1) The vertex form of the parabola is given as $a(x - h)\u00b2 + k$. The vertex for our parabola is $(4, -5)$. Based on this, we can't immediately determine the signs of a, b, or c.\n\n2) Let's consider the fact that this parabola crosses the x-axis in two places, with one being in negative x territory and the other in positive. Hence, this parabola must open upwards for this to be accurate. This would require a to be positive.\n\n3) Then let's consider the x-intercepts. In fact, we can even go ahead and write the quadratic function as $y = a(x - r)(x - s)$ with r and s corresponding to the x-intercepts. If we expand this and equate it to the general quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c), we would find that c = ars. Given that one of r or s is positive and the other is negative, we can reasonably conclude that c must also be positive, as c = ars and a is also positive.\n\nSummarizing, based on the vertex, the intercepts, and the direction the parabola opens, we can conclude that a and c must be positive.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{a, c}.", "round 2": "Upon revisiting my initial answer and examining it in the light of other solutions, I now see a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nThe vertex form of the parabola is $y=a(x-4)^2 -5$, which we agreed signifies an upward-opening parabola because of the nature and position of the vertex and x-intercepts. This indeed confirms that the coefficient $a$ is positive.\n\nHowever, when we expand this into standard form, we get $y = ax^2 - 8ax + 16a - 5$, corresponding to $a, -8a,$ and $16a - 5$ as coefficients of $x^2, x,$ and the constant term, respectively. \n\nAs correctly pointed out by agent 2, my initial assertion that $c = ars$ (where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the parabola) must be wrong. Both roots being one positive and one negative doesn't necessarily mean $c$ has to be positive. Instead, $c = 16a - 5$ as shown in the expanded form, and it depends on the exact value of $a$ whether $c$ would be positive or negative. This term will only be positive if $a$ is greater than $5/16$, which we can't infer from the provided information.\n\nThe coefficient $b = -8a$ can be either positive or negative, depending on the sign of $a$.\n\nMy updated conclusion is, therefore, that only the coefficient $a$ is confirmed to be positive as per the given problem settings.\n\nMy revised answer is \\boxed{a}."}, {"round 0": "The vertex form of a parabola is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where the vertex is $(h,k)$.
