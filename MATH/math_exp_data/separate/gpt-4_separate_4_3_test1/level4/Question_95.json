This will be the length of the side of the inscribed square in triangle ABC.\n\nRound 2:\nNext, let's find the length of a side of triangle ABC. Since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse (side AC) would be the side length of the incribed square (about 3.87 cm) times the square root of 2, which gives us approximately 5.48 cm.\n\nRound 3:\nNow let's consider triangle DEF. Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, the sides of DEF will have the same lengths as the side of ABC. So, the hypotenuse (side DF) will also be approximately 5.48 cm.\n\nRound 4:\nWe can now figure out the side length of the inscribed square in triangle DEF. The side length of an inscribed square in an isosceles right triangle is the length of the hypotenuse divided by the square root of 2.

The area of this square is given as 15 sq.cm. The area of a square is found by squaring its side length. Let's say this side length is $s$. We therefore have $s^2 = 15$, and so $s = \\sqrt{15}$.\n\nStep 2:\nIn an isosceles right triangle, such as $\\triangle ABC$, the side of an inscribed square is half the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle.
