Here, I'll reexamine the problem and solution strategy, redo the calculation and offer an updated solution. \n\nGiven the line: $2x = 3y = -z$, we can equate all these to a parameter, $k_1$ (like we use $t$ for time in parametric equations). Here, we get $x=\\frac{3k_1}{2}$, $y = \\frac{2k_1}{3}$, and $z = -k_1$. So, the direction will just be the vector composed of $\\frac{3}{2}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, $-1$, which is $(3/2, 2/3, -1)$. \n\nFor the line: $6x = -y = -4z$, we do the same process. Letting all equal to another parameter, say $k_2$, we have the system of equations $x = -\\frac{k_2}{6}$, $y = -k_2$, and $z = \\frac{k_2}{4}$. Thus, the direction of this line is $(-1/6, -1, 1/4)$.\n\nWe now have the direction vectors or lines in component form $v1 = (3/2, 2/3, -1)$ and $v2 = (-1/6, -1, 1/4)$. \n\nThe cosine of the angle $\\theta$ between two vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ can be found by the formula:\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac {v_1 \\cdot v_2}{||v_1||\\ ||v_2||}$\n\nHere, \n\n$v_1 \\cdot v_2 = (3/2 * -1/6) + (2/3 * -1) + (-1 * 1/4) = -1/4 - 2/3 - 1/4 = -1$\n\nAlso,\n\n$||v_1|| = \\sqrt{(3/2)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{9/4 + 4/9 + 1} = \\sqrt{53/36} = \\sqrt{53}/6$, and \n\n$||v_2|| = \\sqrt{(-1/6)^2 + (-1)^2 + (1/4)^2} = \\sqrt{1/36 + 1 + 1/16} = \\sqrt{73/36} = \\sqrt{73}/6$\n\nSo we have: \n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac {-1}{\\sqrt{53}/6 * \\sqrt{73}/6} = \\frac {-1}{\\sqrt{(53*73)/36}} =  \\frac {-1}{\\sqrt{53*73}/6}$\n\nTherefore, $\\theta = \\arccos \\left(\\frac {-1}{\\sqrt{53*73}/6}\\right) \u2248 107.19$ in degrees, which lies in the second quadrant. \n\nHowever, the angle between two lines is the smaller angle that one line makes with the other, which lies in the first quadrant. The returned arc cosine of a function in degrees is between $0$ and $180$ but our angle is beyond $90$ degrees, it is appropriate to subtract from 180, because cosine of $(180 - \\theta)$ equals to cosine $\\theta$. So we should take $180 - 107.19 = 72.81$ degrees. \n\nGiven the higher accuracy in this calculation, the solution for the angle between the lines is about \\boxed{72.81^\\circ} to two decimal places."}]}
