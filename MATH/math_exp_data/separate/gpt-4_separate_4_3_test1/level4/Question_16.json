They are even numbers and as we know, every even number can be written in the form $2m$, for some integer $m$. So, there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $n = 2a$ and $n+2 = 2b$. Thus, the smaller square can be expressed as $4a^2$ and the larger square can be expressed as $4b^2$. Then, the given problem can be rephrased as $4b^2 - 4a^2 = 268$.\n\nRound 2:\n\nWe can simplify the equation $4b^2 - 4a^2 = 268$ by dividing each term by 4 which results in $b^2 - a^2 = 67$. We recognize this difference of squares formula, so we rewrite it in its factorized form: $(b - a)(b + a) = 67$. Since $67$ is a prime number, the two factors $b - a$ and $b + a$ must be 1 and 67, in some order.\n\nRound 3:\n\nSince $b$ is larger than $a$, $(b - a) < (b + a)$. So, we must have $b - a = 1$ and $b + a = 67$. Solving these as a pair of simultaneous equations gives $a = 33$ and $b = 34$. Thus, $n = 2a = 2*33 = 66$ and $n+2 = 2b = 2*34 = 68$.\n\nFinal Round:\n\nThe question asks for the larger square.
