In other words, we need to find the solutions to the equation:\n\nz * w = a * c - b * d + (a * d + b * c)i = 1\n\nRound 2:\nThe complex number 1 here can be written as 1 + 0i. So we can separate the real (Re) and imaginary (Im) parts on both sides:\nRe: a * c - b * d = 1   and   Im: a * d + b * c = 0\n\nThe second equation implies that ad = -bc. Therefore, b = -ad/c if c \u2260 0 or a = 0 if c = 0. We can substitute this into the first equation to find the possible (a, b, c, d).\n\nRound 3:\nNow we can split our analysis into two parts:\n1) c \u2260 0: We get a\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (ac - 1)/d\u00b2 which after rearrangement becomes a\u00b2d\u00b2 = c\u00b2ac - c\u00b2. The left hand side is a perfect square so the right hand side must be a perfect square as well. Since c \u2260 0 this tells us that ac - 1 must also be a perfect square.\n\nFor every integer value of a, there is exactly one integer value of c that makes ac - 1 a perfect square. This is because for every positive integer n, adding or subtracting 1 results in a unique integer not equal to n, so we have a one-to-one correspondence between the integer values of a and c that make ac - 1 a perfect square.\n\nAlso, note that for every integer value of a, and the corresponding integer value of c, there exist two integer values of d (namely \u00b1a) that satisfy a\u00b2d\u00b2 = c\u00b2ac - c\u00b2, since squaring removes the sign of a number.\n\n2) c = 0: The two equations become a * 0 - b * d = 1 and a * d + b * 0 = 0. This leads us to two possible solutions: a = \u00b11 and b = 0 (because if b \u2260 0, the second equation implies that a/d = 0 which forces a = 0 and conflicts with the first equation). These two solutions must be included as well.\n\nRound 4:\nCombining both cases, for each integer value a \u2260 0, we have a unique (c, d) pair and hence a unique pair of units in S.

From case 2, we have 2 additional solutions (a =  \u00b11). Therefore, the number of units in S is (4\u2124 - 2) + 2 = 4\u2124.

After analyzing these equations and the solutions from the other agents, I agree with their logic that the units (when squared) must equal $1$, which the integers $-1$ and $1$ satisfy.\n\nMoreover, for a complex number $w$ to stay integer-valued, the denominator of $w$, $a^{2}+b^{2}$, must be able to divide a perfect square, and hence must itself be a perfect square. This leads us to the conclusion that $a^{2}+b^{2}$ could only be $1$. This criterion only applies to the cases where $(a,b)$ is $(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of units in the set is $\\boxed{4}$ ($1$, $-1$, $i$, $-i$), as obtained by other agents.

Consequently, $a^2 + b^2$ must be a divisor of $1$, and as such, can only be either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nHowever, taking into account that both $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can infer that $a^2 + b^2$ should be non-negative, thus $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.\n\nFrom this, the only combinations we can obtain are $(a, b) = (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)$, which correspond to the Gauss integers $1, -1, i$, and $-i$.\n\nThus, after the thorough revision, my updated solution to the problem will be \\boxed{4} units in the set $S$."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: \n\nLet z = a + bi and w = c + di for some integers a, b, c, d.
