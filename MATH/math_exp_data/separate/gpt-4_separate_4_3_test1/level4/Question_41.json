The problem describes a scenario where Mr. Madoff invests $1000 in a fund that compounds annually for three years. The important terms to note are \"compounds annually\" and \"three years\". \n\nThe annual compounding means that the interest is added to the original sum at the end of each year. The formula used to calculate compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n\n- A is the total amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (in decimals).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nIn this situation, interest is compounded annually, meaning it is compounded once per year, so n = 1. Since the investment is held for three years, t = 3. A = 1225 dollars, and P = 1000 dollars. The task is to find r, the annual interest rate.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the compound interest formula and solve for r:\n\n1225 = 1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3)\n\nDividing each side by 1000 gives us \n\n1.225 = (1 + r)^3\n\nTaking the cubed root of each side gives\n\n1.07 = 1 + r\n\nSubtracting 1 from each side gives r = 0.07.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100 to get 7%. \n\nTherefore, the annual interest rate for Mr. Madoff's investment is \\boxed{7}.", "round 1": "The problem is asking for the interest rate of an investment which grows from $1000 to $1225 over three years due to annual compounding.\n\nWe can start off by using the formula for compound interest which is\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nHere,\n    - A is the total amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.

Here, P = $1000.\n    - r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), which we are trying to find\n    - n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. As compounding is done annually in this case, n = 1.\n    - t is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for. Here, t = 3.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n1225 = 1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3)\n\nCleaning up the equation, we can simplify it to:\n\n1.225 = (1 + r)^3\n\nMake r the subject of the formula, by first taking the cubic root of both sides:\n\n1.07 = 1 + r\n\nAnd finally, subtract 1 from both sides to isolate r:\n\nr = 1.07 - 1 = 0.07\n\nSince r is in decimal form, we convert the decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100.
