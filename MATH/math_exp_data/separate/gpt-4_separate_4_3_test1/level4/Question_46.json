In simpler words, if we apply $f(x)$ to a value, and then apply $f^{-1}(x)$ to the result, we should get back the original value. When framed as an equation, this looks like $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.  We can also look at $f^{-1}(x)$ as the function that undoes what $f(x)$ does.\n\nStep 2: Solving for $f(f(10))$\n\nThe question is asking for $f(f(10))$ this is equivalent to asking for $f(h(1))$ since according to the problem's given conditions, $h(1) = 2$ and from the definition of $h(x)$, $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$. Hence, $f^{-1}(1) = 2$, reversing the relation we have $f(2) = 1$. But we know from the initial conditions that $h(2) = 10$. Remembering that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$, then $f^{-1}(2) = 10$, and therefore $f(10) = 2$.\n\nThus, for $f(f(10))$, we substitute $f(10) = 2$ into the function which equals $f(2)$. Now based on our earlier computation, we know that $f(2) = 1$. Therefore, $f(f(10)) = \\boxed{1}$. \n\nThis means applying the function $f(x)$ twice to the argument of 10 returns us the value 1.
