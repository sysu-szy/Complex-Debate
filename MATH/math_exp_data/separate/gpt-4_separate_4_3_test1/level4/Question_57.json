Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \n\nLet's begin by understanding what we've been given. Marika used a loan to pay for $80\\%$ of the total price of the house, and used her savings, which we know is specifically $\\$49,400$, to cover the remaining cost. So it means the $\\$49,400$ is the remaining $20\\%$ of the total cost of the house. \n\nRound 2:\n\nLet's express the above understanding as an equation. If we denote the total purchase price of the house as $P$, then, based on the given information:\n\n$0.80P + 49400 = P$\n\nThis is because the sum of the amounts paid by the loan and savings should add up to the total price, $P$.\n\nRound 3:\n\nWe can manipulate this equation to find the value of $P$. First, let's isolate terms with $P$ on one side of the equation:\n\n$0.80P - 0.80P = P - 0.80P$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$0 = 0.20P - 49400$\n\nRound 4:\n\nNext, let's add 49400 to both sides to isolate the term with $P$ on the left side:\n\n$49400 = 0.20P$\n\nNow, to find $P$, we divide both sides of the equation by $0.20$:\n\n$P = \\frac{49400}{0.20}$\n\nRound 5:\n\nCarrying out this division gives us:\n\n$P = \\$247,000$\n\nSo the total purchase price of the house was \\$247,000.\n\nThus, our final answer is \\boxed{247000}.", "round 1": "Reviewing the previous analysis and the helpful inputs from the other agents, I verify that the reasoning and calculations are sound and correct.
