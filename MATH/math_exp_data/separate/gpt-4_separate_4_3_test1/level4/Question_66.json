For \u03bb = 1, we have:\n\n(3 - 1)x + -4y = 0 -> 2x = 4y -> x = 2y\n\nSo the basis for the eigenspace is y = 1, x = 2 hence { (2, 1) }. So:\n\nP = { (2, 1) }, D = { (1, 0), (0, 1) }, and P^-1 = { (2, -1) }\n\nSo,\n\nA^2016 =  P * D^2016 * P^-1 \n\n       = { (2, 1) } * { (1, 0), (0, 1) }^2016 * { (2, -1) }\n\nWe note all terms of D^2016 are simply 1 to the power of 2016 (as diagonal matrices are just the eigenvalues to the power). Hence D^2016 = D, so:\n\nA^2016 = { (2, 1) } * { (1, 0), (0, 1) } * { (2, -1) }\n\nMultiplying these matrices out will lead to the original matrix:\n\nA^2016 = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nTherefore, \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}^{2016}\\] = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]. So, we can say the given matrix raised to the power of 2016 gives the matrix itself.\n\nSo, our final answer is \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}}.", "round 1": "Rechecking the solution steps and the reasoning processes of other agents, I stand by my original solution. The main confusion arose from a misunderstanding or mistake in the calculation of the eigenvalues.\n\nFor the given matrix A = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\], the characteristic polynomial to find the eigenvalues is \u03c1(A - \u03bbI) = 0, \n\nPlugging in, we get ((3 - \u03bb)*(-1 - \u03bb)) - (1 * -4) = \u03bb^2 - 2\u03bb + 1 = (\u03bb - 1)^2 = 0\n\nThe roots are \u03bb = 1 with multiplicity 2. This is not equivalent to \u03bb1 = 1 - \u221a2 and \u03bb2 = 1 + \u221a2 as stated by agent solution0.\n\nThe agent solution1, despite coming closer, made an error while finding the eigenvalues, leading to the incorrect eigenvectors and decomposition.\n\nThe agent solution2 made a mistake in multiplying the matrix with itself. While squaring the matrix, it should still have resulted in the original matrix and not 2 times the original matrix. That means, \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nThus, the same property holds true for the given matrix even when raised to the power of 2016, which means \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}^{2016} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nSo our final answer is, \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}}.", "round 2": "With due respect to all the agents, I fundamentally disagree with their proposed solutions to this problem. The main understanding lies in finding the eigenvalues and their respective eigenvectors correctly. \n\nLet's revisit the solution step by step systematically,\n\nStep 1: Computation of eigenvalues\nThe matrix, A is given by\nA = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThe characteristic equation for a matrix to find the eigenvalues is given by \ndet(A - \u03bbI) = 0\n\nSo here, \ndet \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \u03bb & -4 \\\\ 1 & -\u03bb \\end{pmatrix} = (3 - \u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1)(-4)\\]\nEquating to zero gets us \n\u03bb^2 - 3\u03bb + 4 = 0\nSolving for \u03bb gives us,\n\u03bb = 2, 1\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are \u03bb1 = 2 and \u03bb2 = 1.\n\nStep 2: Computation of eigenvectors pertaining to the eigenvalues\nLet's find the corresponding eigenvectors for these eigenvalues separately:\n\nSubstituting \u03bb1 = 2 into A - \u03bbI = 0, we get\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nReading from the first row of this matrix, we get the equation 1v1 - 4v2 = 0, which leads to the first eigenvector,\nV1 = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nNow, substituting \u03bb2 = 1 into A - \u03bbI = 0, we get,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -4 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nReading from the first row of this matrix, also gives us the equation 2v1 - 4v2 = 0, which leads to the second eigenvector, \nV2 = \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nStep 3: Diagonalization and Computing A^n\nWith the computed eigenvalues and their respective eigenvectors, we form the matrix P = [V1, V2] and its inverse.
