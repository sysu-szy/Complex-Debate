Therefore we can calculate $d$ by finding and adding the distances from the point $(0, 0)$ to each of the foci.\n\nThe length of the semi-major axis of the ellipse is 7 (the distance from the center of the ellipse to a point on the ellipse along the x-axis) and the length of the semi-minor axis is 5 (the distance from the center of the ellipse to a point on the ellipse along the y-axis). \n\nThe distance between each of the foci and the center of the ellipse (the distance $c$) is given by the formula: \n\\[c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}\\]\n\nwhere $a$ is the semi-major axis length and $b$ is the semi-minor axis length.

We correctly used the distances from the point (0, 0) on the ellipse to each focus to find the constant sum. To confirm, we can consider any other point on the ellipse.\n\nLets consider the farthest point (6,0) on the ellipse from the center to the foci, the distance from this point of the ellipse to each of the foci would be equivalent to the length of the major axis, $2a=14$. That means our original solution of \\[d = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{24}\\] was incorrect.

For a point on the ellipse that is a vertex of the major axis, this distance is exactly twice the semi-major axis, $2a$.\n\nStep 4: Calculating the Constant Sum.\nWe previously found that the semi-major axis length, $a$, was 7 units.

It is $2$ units.\n\nIn an ellipse, the distance $d$ (sometimes called the major axis) is equal to the sum of the distances from each focus to a point on the boundary of the ellipse. Since the ellipse is symmetric along the x-axis, we can choose our point to be the rightmost point of the ellipse which is $7$ units to the right of the left focus.\n\nThen, the distance from this point to the left focus is $7$ units, and the distance to the right focus (the distance between the two foci, $2$ units, added to one focus-to-edge distance) is $7 + 2 = 9$ units.\n\nAdding these two distances together gives us $d = 7 + 9 = \\boxed{16}.$", "round 1": "Observing the diagram, we can see that the ellipse extends 6 units to the right of the rightmost focus, and 7 units to the left of the leftmost focus.\n\nRecall that by definition of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is a constant $d$.
