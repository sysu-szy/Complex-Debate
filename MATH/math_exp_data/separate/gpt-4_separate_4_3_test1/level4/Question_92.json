{"question": "Lincoln Elementary School has 120 students. Of these 120 students, $\\frac{2}{5}$ ride the bus to school and $\\frac{5}{12}$ have a parent drive them to school.

Since the total fraction of students is $\\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\\[\\frac{120}{120} - \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{5}{12}.\\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.\n\nTo get this common denominator for the fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\\frac{48}{120}$.\n\nTo get the common denominator for $\\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\\frac{50}{120}$.
