In particular, we will use the fact that $sin^2 (x) = \\frac{1-cos(2x)}{2}$, and by extension, $(sin(x))^2k+1 = P_k(cos(2x),sin(x)) = P_k' (cos(2x), sin^2(x))$, where $P_k$ and $P_k'$ are polynomials in $k$ variables.\n\nSecondly, we recall the concept of linear independence of functions. Four functions $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$ are linearly independent if there doesn't exist a set of constants $C1, C2, C3, C4$ not all zero such that $C1\u00b7f_1(x) + C2\u00b7f_2(x) + C3\u00b7f_3(x) + C4\u00b7f_4(x) = 0$.\n\nBearing these concepts in mind, we observe that $\\sin 7x$, $\\sin 5x$, $\\sin 3x$, and $\\sin x$ are all linearly independent because they oscillate at different frequencies.

However, this contradicts the property of $(\\sin x)^7$, namely, that its maximum absolute value on each half-period is 1, while the maximum absolute value of $\\sin x$ on each half-period is 1.\n\nSo, the equation cannot be satisfied with real $a,b,c,d$, and thus we can't find the value of $d$.\n\nSo the final answer is, this problem has no solution.", "round 1": "Going over everyone's answers, I have found discrepencies.

Thus, there is no unique solution for $d$.
