Knowing that the equation of a hyperbola can be parametrized by its semi-major axis (a), semi-minor axis (b), and the ratio between them (which gives the slopes of the asymptotes), I found b by deducing from the fact that the slopes of the asymptotes were equal to b/a that b must be 2a, and hence, b was 2. \n\n4.

The distance between the vertices of a hyperbola is not the same as the distance between the foci of a hyperbola which was my mistake in the previous solution. The distance between the vertices is equal to the length of the major axis (also known as transverse axis in the context of hyperbolas) while the distance between the foci is larger than this.\n\nHowever, the distance between the center and a vertex is indeed equal to half the distance of the transverse axis of the hyperbola, as both the other agents and I had initially considered. \n\nThe distance from the center to either focus (c) of a hyperbola can be calculated using the formula $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, where $a$ is the distance from the center to a vertex and $b$ is the distance from the center to a conjugate axis.\n\nBut since it's a square relationship, let's consider this way: $2c = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2}$, where $2a$ is the length of the transverse axis, and $2b$ is the length of the conjugate axis.
