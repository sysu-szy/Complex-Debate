The Central Angle Theorem states that the measure of an intercepted arc equals the measure of its central angle (a central angle x at the center of a circle intersects an arc of measure x on the circle's circumference).

It states that the measure of an intercepted arc equals twice the measure of its inscribed angle (an inscribed angle x on the circle's circumference intersects an arc of measure 2x on the circle). Here, the intercepted arc is $RTB$. As a result, the measure of arc $RB$ is twice $\\angle RTB$, or $2\\times28$ degrees, equal to $56$ degrees: $RB=56$ degrees.\n\nRound 3: \n\nHaving established these arcs, we should remember that in general, the sum of the measures of arc $RS$, arc $ST$, and arc $TB$ should always equal $360$ degrees, the total degrees in a circle.\n\nThe unknown here is arc $ST$. If we find that, we could then easily get the measure of arc $BR$ since arc $BR=RS+ST$.\n\nSince $RS+ST+TB=360$ degrees, we then have $74 + ST + 56 = 360$, which we can rearrange to find the measure of arc $ST$ as $ST=360-74-56=230$ degrees. \n\nRound 4:\n\nSo, we have found that the measure of arc $ST$ is $230$ degrees. \n\nNow, since the measure of arc $BR$ equals the measure of arc $RS$ plus the measure of arc $ST$, we have $BR=RS+ST=74 + 230 = 304$ degrees.\n\nTherefore, the measure of minor arc $BR = \\boxed{304}$ degrees."}]}
