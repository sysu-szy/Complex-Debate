This number must not only be palindromic (looks the same forward and backward), but also a prime number. That is, a number that is not a product of a multiplication operation.\n\nStarting from 17, next prime is 19. However, 91 is not a prime number since it can be divided by 7 and 13 apart from 1 and itself. So 19 is not a reversible prime.\n\nNext up is 23. When we reverse 23, we get 32 which is not a prime as it can be divided by 2, 4, 8, and 16, so 23 is not a reversible prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 29. When we reverse 29, we get 92 which is also not a prime number (divisible by 2, 4, 23, 46) so 29 is also not a reversible prime.\n\nNext two numbers are 31 and 37 but their reversals, 13 and 73, are not prime.\n\nThe next prime number, 41, meets our criteria. When reversed, it becomes 14, which is not a prime.\n\nThe next prime numbers are 43 and 47. When reversed, 43 becomes 34 which is not a prime number and 47 becomes 74 which is also not a prime number.\n\nFinally, 53 is the next prime number. The reverse of 53 is 35 which is not a prime number.\n\nThe next prime number is 59. Reversing 59 gives 95 which is itself not prime.\n\nThe next one is 61 and its reverse is 16. Unfortunately, 16 is not a prime number.\n\nLastly, we look at number 71, its reverse is 17. Both 71 and 17 are prime numbers.\n\nAs such, we have identified the smallest reversible prime greater than seventeen.

To do this, we need to check numbers one by one, verifying whether they are prime and if their reversal is also prime. \n\n1) Starting from the smallest prime number greater than 17, we have 19. The reversal, 91, is not prime because it is divisible by 7 and 13.\n\n2) The next prime number 23 has a reversed version, 32, which is also not prime because it is divisible by 2, 4, 8, and 16.\n\n3) The next prime number 29 has 92 as its reversal, which is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 4, 23, and 46.\n\n4) The next prime number is 31, and 13 is its reversal. Both of these numbers are prime, so we have found a prime whose reversal is also prime.\n\nTherefore, looking at the solutions from the other agents, it seems that there was a miscalculation in my original solution. While 71 is a reversible prime (since the reversal, 17, is also prime), it is not the smallest reversible prime which is greater than 17. The correct answer should be 31, as the reversed number 13 is also prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest reversible prime greater than 17 is \\boxed{31}.", "round 2": "In response to the other agents, we are all in agreement. The task is to locate the smallest prime number greater than 17, which is a reversible prime- that is, a prime that remains prime when its digits are reversed. \n\nWe initiate our process with the smallest prime number greater than 17, which is 19. But when we reverse this number it becomes 91, which is not prime as it\u2019s divisible by 7 and 13.\n\nNext, we consider 23, the subsequent prime number. Upon reversing this number we get 32, which is not prime as it's divisible by 2.\n\nWe subsequently test 29. Unfortunately, the reversed number 92, isn't prime because it's divisible by 2.\n\nOur last prime number to test is 31, which when reversed forms 13, which is a prime number.

Let's test each prime number above 17 in the order of their size.\n\nThe prime numbers greater than 17, starting from smallest to largest, are as follows: 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. We can discard two-digit primes whose reversed number ends with an even number (except 2) or 5, because a number ending in 0,2,4,5,6,8 becomes composite.

When prime numbers are reversed, the resulting number must also be prime for the original number to be a reversible prime.\n\nWhen applying this rule to 17 and the numbers following it, the first prime number we come across is 19. However, 91 (the reversal of 19) is not a prime number as it has more divisors than 1 and itself.
