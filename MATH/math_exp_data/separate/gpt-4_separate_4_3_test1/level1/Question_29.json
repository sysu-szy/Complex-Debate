Assuming that each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each horse has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c+4h &= 30 \\\\\nc + h &= 10 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo solve for $h$, we need to eliminate $c$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $c=10-h$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$ gives $2(10-h)+4h = 30$, or $h=5$.

Let's denote the number of clowns as C and the number of horses as H. \n\nWe know two things from the problem: \n1) The total number of heads is 10. Thus, C + H = 10.\n2) The total number of legs is 30. Since each clown has 2 legs and each horse has 4, we also know that 2C + 4H = 30. \n\nTo simplify the second equation, we can divide the entire equation by 2, giving us C + 2H = 15. \n\nNow, you have a system of two equations:\n\nC + H = 10\nC + 2H = 15\n\nTo solve the system, subtract the first equation from the second. If we subtract C + H =10 from C + 2H = 15, we get H = 5.\n\nThis means there were 5 horses in the parade. \n\nTo verify, we can substitute H =5 into the first equation, C + H = 10, to find C.

We know that every animal in the parade, whether it is a horse or a clown, has one head. So the total number of heads is exactly the same as the total number of animals.

Every horse has 4 legs and every clown has 2 legs (since clowns are presumably human).
