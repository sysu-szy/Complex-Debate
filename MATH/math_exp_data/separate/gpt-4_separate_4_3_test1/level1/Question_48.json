An asymptote will occur whenever the denominator of a fraction is equal to zero (provided that the numerator is not also zero at that value of x).\n\nSo, set $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = 0$. \n\nThis is a cubic equation and it might look tough to solve. However, it's a special type of cubic equation called a depressed cubic, because it doesn't have an $x^2$ term. This cubic is also familiar as it is related to the Speculative Identity: $(a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$. \n\nIn our case, with $a = x$ and $b = 1$, our cubic equation can be written as $(x-1)^3 = 0$. Solving this for $x$, we only get one value $x = 1$.\n\nThis means the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ has 1 vertical asymptote at $x = 1$. Unless x is a multiple root of the denominator (i.e., it appears more than once when the denominator is fully factored), every root of the denominator will create a single vertical asymptote.
