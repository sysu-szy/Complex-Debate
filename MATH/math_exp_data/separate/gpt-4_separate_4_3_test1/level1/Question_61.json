While my solution and solutions 1 and 2 assert that the value of n is 72 degrees, solution 0 states that n should be -108 degrees because the value of n we are looking for is in the 4th quadrant.\n\nThe contradiction arises from a misunderstanding in solution 0. While it is correct that tan is positive in the 4th quadrant, the value of n doesn't necessarily have to be located in the 4th quadrant when the tan of the given angle is positive and greater than 1. This is because tan is also positive in the 1st quadrant, where angles range from 0 to 90 degrees.
