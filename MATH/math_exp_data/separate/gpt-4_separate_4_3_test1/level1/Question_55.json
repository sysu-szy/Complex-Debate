Let's start by observing the structure of this expression. \n\nRound 2:\nNotice that this is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ where $a = 1$, $b = 10$, and $c = 25$. This is considered as a perfect square quadratic because it can be written as a square of binomial. \n\nRound 3:\nIn a perfect square quadratic equation, the square root of the first term equals the first term of the binomial, the square root of the last term equals the last term of the binomial, and twice the product of the square roots equals to the middle term of the quadratic equation.\n\nSo, if we take the square root of $r^2$, we get $r$. Similarly, if we take the square root of $25$, we get $5$. Notice that twice the product of $r$ and $5$ gives $10r$, which is exactly our middle term in the quadratic equation.\n\nRound 4:\nBased on these observations, we can express the original quadratic equation as a square of a binomial. $r^2+10r+25$ can hence be factored as $(r+5)^2$.\n\n\nSo, the given expression $r^2+10r+25$ can be factored as $(r+5)^2$.
