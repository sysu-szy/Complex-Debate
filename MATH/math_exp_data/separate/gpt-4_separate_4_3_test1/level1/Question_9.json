In particular, we know that the tangent function has a period of 180 degrees, meaning that every 180 degrees, the tangent function repeats its values. This property is derived from the unit circle, where the same y/x ratio repeats every 180\u00b0. So, the tangent function has the property written as:\n\n$\\tan (\\theta + 180k) = \\tan (\\theta)$, \n\nwhere $k$ is any integer. This means that tan(\u03b8) is the same as tan(\u03b8 plus any multiple of 180 degrees).\n\nRound 2:\nNow to solve for $n$, we can use this property. Since we need an integer $-90 < n < 90$, we will adjust $252\u00b0$ by subtracting $180\u00b0$ to fit it into the required range:\n\n$252\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 72\u00b0$.\n\nRound 3:\nNow we see that $72\u00b0$ still lies outside the range $-90\u00b0 < n < 90\u00b0$.
