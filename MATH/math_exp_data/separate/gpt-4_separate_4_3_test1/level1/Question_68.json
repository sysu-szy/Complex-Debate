Additionally, everything in circle $C$ is in circle $B$ and everything in circle $B$ is in circle $A$. We are told that there are exactly 20 items in $A$ and 10 of those items are in $A$, but not in $B$. This means that there is a total of $$20-10=10$$ items in circle $B$. we are also told that there are 7 items in circle $C$.

The problem also states that there are 7 items in circle $C$. Since $C$ is entirely within the intersection of $A$ and $B$, these 7 items must also be among the 10 items that are in both circles $A$ and $B$. \n\nSo, we can now say that there are $10 - 7 = 3$ items in the intersection of circles $A$ and $B$ that are not in circle $C$. \n\nThis number (3) represents the items that are in circle $B$ but not in $C$, as these items are in the portion of the $B$ region that is outside of $C$.\n\nSo, the number of items that are in circle $B$, but not in circle $C$ is \\boxed{3}.", "round 1": "Examining the problem carefully gives us the following crucial information:\n\n- 20 items are in circle A\n- Out of these 20, 10 are not in B.

The problem statement does not provide information on this. Given this lack of information, the most accurate response we can provide is that there are \\boxed{3} items in B but not in C, plus any items which might be only in B (not in A and C).

There are 20 items in $A$, with 10 of them not in $B$. This means that there are 20 - 10 = 10 items in both $A$ and $B$.\n2. There are 7 items in $C$. Since $C$ is entirely contained within $B$, all of these 7 items are also in $B$. But, they are not in $B$ but not in $C$. Therefore, among the 10 items that are in both $A$ and $B$, 7 are also in $C$. So, there are 10 - 7 = 3 items in both $A$ and $B$ but not in $C$.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"how many items are in $B$, but not in $C$?\" would be the number of items in $A$ and $B$ but not in $C$ (which is 3) plus the number of items in $B$ but not in $A$ or $C$. \n\nThe problem doesn't provide information about how many items are in $B$ but not in $A$ or $C$, so without that information we can't give a specific numerical answer.

If the number of items in set $B$ is only those in $A$ and $C$, the minimum number of items in $B$, but not in $C$ would be 3.
