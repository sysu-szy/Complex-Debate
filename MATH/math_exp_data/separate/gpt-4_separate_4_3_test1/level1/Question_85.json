Hence, 10! and 15!, by their very definitions, include all factors of 5! within their product.\n2. The greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of numbers cannot exceed the smallest number in the set. Thus, since 5! is the smallest factorial among the given set, the GCF will not be more than 5!.\n3.

Consequently, the bigger factorial numbers like 10! and 15! naturally encase the factors of the smaller one, 5!, within their product.\n2. The greatest common factor between given numbers can never surpass the smallest number among them. Ergo, with 5! being the smallest factorial here, the greatest common factor can be 120 at max.\n3.
