This is because when we divide a number by a certain divisor, the result can be written as the divisor multiplied by the quotient plus the remainder. In this case, the divisor is 7, the remainder is 5, and k is the quotient we don't know.

It's because 5*3 (15) is the largest quantity that is less than 17 which can be found by multiplying 5. The remainder is the leftover amount after subtracting this 15 from 17.
