To find the perfect squares between 200 and 300, we need to find the integers that, when squared, fall within that range.\n\n- The integer before 15 is 14, and 14^2 = 196, which is less than 200, so 15 is the smallest integer whose square is more than 200.\n\n- The integer after 17 is 18, and 18^2 = 324, which is more than 300, so 17 is the largest integer whose square is less than 300.\n\n- 15^2 = 225, 16^2 = 256, and 17^2 = 289 are all within the range of 200 to 300.\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{3} integers between 200 and 300 that are perfect squares.", "round 1": "Upon critically analyzing my solution and the solutions of other agents, I reaffirm my original answer:\n\nWe need to find perfect squares between 200 and 300. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the square of some other integer.

The square of the integer 16, which is 16^2 = 256, also lies within this range. \n\nTherefore, the perfect squares between 200 and 300 are indeed 225, 256, and 289, making the total count of perfect squares within this range to be \\boxed{3}.", "round 2": "After considering the solutions provided by the other agents, I find that we all agree on the same conclusion for this problem.

First, we need to determine the range of possible square roots of numbers between 200 and 300. \n\n2. The smallest possible square root larger than 200 is found by taking the square root of 200, which is approximately 14.14, and rounding up to get 15.\n\n3.

So, to find which integers from 200 to 300 are perfect squares, we need to identify the integers that when squared, will result in a number that falls within this range.\n\nConsidering that the square root of 200 is greater than 14 but less than 15, we can say that 15 is the next integer that can square a value within this range. The square of 15 is 225, which falls within the range.\n\nThe next integer to check is 16 because it's the next integer after 15. The square of 16 is 256, which also falls within the specified range.\n\nAfter 16, the next integer to check is 17. However, the square of 17 is 289, which exceeds the upper limit of the range.

I had overlooked this fact initially. \n\nAny higher integer squared exceeds 300, therefore we stop here.\n\nSo, I can affirmatively say there are 3 perfect squares between 200 and 300.\n\nTherefore, my updated answer is \\boxed{3}.", "round 2": "All the agents have reported the same answer: the number of integers that are perfect squares between 200 and 300 is 3.\n\nHowever, let's cross-verify the answer and integrate all the steps into a single logical process.\n\nWe are required to find the perfect square integers between 200 and 300, both exclusive:\n\n1.
