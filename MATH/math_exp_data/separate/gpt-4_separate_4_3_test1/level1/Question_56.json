We could, but it would be time-consuming and unnecessary. Instead, we can use an arithmetic sequence approach.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members is a constant. Here, the common difference is 1. \n\nThe general form of an Arithmetic Sequence is: a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ..., where a = first term, d = difference between the terms. Here, a = 25 and d = 1.\n\nNow, the nth term of an Arithmetic Sequence is given by the formula: a + (n-1)d.\n\nWe know that the last term (100 in our case) equals to 25 + 1(n-1). We need to find n.\n\nRewriting this, we have 100 = 25 + (n-1)*1.\n\nSolving this equation, we subtract 25 from both sides: 75 = n - 1.\n\nAdding 1 to each side gives: 76 = n.\n\nThus, there are 76 numbers in the list $25, 26, 27, \\ldots, 99, 100.$ So the answer is \\boxed{76}.", "round 1": "After considering all the points raised by others and reassessing my own solution, it is clear that we're all in agreement on how to approach this problem.\n\nIrrespective of the method used, there are 76 numbers in the list $25, 26, 27, \\ldots, 99, 100.$ Here's my revised step-by-step solution:\n\n1.

Add one to the result.\n\n   This results in: 75 + 1 = 76\n\nThe reason we add one is to ensure we count the end number, which would be ignored if we simply subtracted the two limiting numbers.\n\nTherefore, my updated answer is \\boxed{76}. My previous solution was correct - hence, my initial solution is confirmed, seeing as everybody obtained the same number via slightly different paths.

No matter how we look at it, we indeed get 76 as the number of integers between 25 and 100, both inclusive.\n\nTo explain my approach once again:\n\n1. Deduct the smallest number in the list from the largest. Thus, 100 - 25 = 75.\n2. Since both 25 and 100 are part of the list, we must ensure they're both included in the count. This is accomplished by adding one to the result from the above operation.\n\nHence, the solution is 75 + 1, which equals 76.\n\nIn conclusion, the list $25, 26, 27, \\ldots, 99, 100$ includes a total number of \\boxed{76} integers."}, {"round 0": "This problem is essentially asking for the count of integers from 25 to 100 inclusive.
