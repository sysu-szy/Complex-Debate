For a quadratic to be greater than zero, it means that it either lies entirely above the x-axis or entirely below the x-axis. To find the conditions for this inequality, we need to analyze the quadratic equation itself.\n\nStep 2: Determining the Roots of the Quadratic Equation\nThe roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn our case, the roots are given by:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}$$\n\nFor the quadratic inequality to hold true, the quadratic equation needs to have no real roots (i.e., the roots are complex or non-real numbers). In other words, the discriminant $b^2-4c$ should be negative.\n\nStep 3: Finding the Range of 'b'\nWe can determine the range of 'b' based on the fact that the quadratic inequality holds true for $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$. This means that the quadratic equation has no real roots when $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$.\n\nAnalyzing the two intervals separately:\n- For $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)$, both roots should not be real. This happens when the discriminant $b^2-4c$ is negative.\n- For $x\\in (3,\\infty)$, the same condition holds true.\n\nSince the quadratic function has the same behavior in both intervals, we can assume that $b^2-4c<0$ for the entire range $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$.\n\nStep 4: Simplifying 'b+c'\nTo simplify 'b+c', we need to express 'b' and 'c' in terms of some variables. Let's solve the inequality $b^2-4c<0$ and represent 'b' in terms of 'c'.\n\nStarting with $b^2-4c<0$, we add 4c to both sides:\n\n$$b^2 < 4c$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both positive and negative square roots:\n\n$$b < \\pm 2\\sqrt{c}$$\n\nSince both positive and negative roots are valid, we can express 'b' as:\n\n$$b < 2\\sqrt{c} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b > -2\\sqrt{c}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the interval $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$. We observe that $b$ can vary in this range, so we choose the wider interval from $-2\\sqrt{c}$ to $2\\sqrt{c}$. Therefore, we can express 'b' as:\n\n$$b \\in (-2\\sqrt{c}, 2\\sqrt{c})$$\n\nNow, we can express 'c' in terms of 'b' as:\n\n$$c = \\frac{b^2}{4}$$\n\nSubstituting this into 'b+c', we get:\n\n$$b+c = \\frac{b^2}{4} + b = \\frac{b^2 + 4b}{4}$$\n\nStep 5: Finding the Value of 'b+c'\nTo find the value of 'b+c', we need to determine the maximum and minimum values of $\\frac{b^2 + 4b}{4}$. The vertex of the quadratic function occurs at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nIn our case, $a=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $b$ can vary in the interval $(-2\\sqrt{c}, 2\\sqrt{c})$. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$$x = -\\frac{b}{2\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}} = -2b$$\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic function occurs at $x = -2b$.\n\nSince the quadratic function opens upwards (the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive), the value of $b+c$ is minimum at the vertex. Hence, the minimum value of $b+c$ occurs at $x = -2b$.\n\nNow, substitute $x = -2b$ into the quadratic inequality:\n\n$$(-2b)^2 + b(-2b) + c > 0$$\n\n$$4b^2 - 2b^2 + c > 0$$\n\n$$2b^2 + c > 0$$\n\nFrom this inequality, we can deduce that $2b^2 + c$ should always be positive. To minimize this value, we set $2b^2 = 0$, which gives $b = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $b+c$ is obtained when $b = 0$, and we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$$b+c = \\frac{0^2 + 4(0)}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0$$\n\nStep 6: Final Answer\nAfter analyzing the given quadratic inequality and solving step by step, we find that $b+c = \\boxed{0}$.", "round 1": "Analyzing the given quadratic inequality, $x^2+bx+c>0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$, we can determine the conditions on the coefficients.\n\nWe can rewrite the inequality as $x^2+bx+c = (x-a)(x-b) > 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation. \n\nFor the quadratic expression to be positive, both roots must lie outside the interval $(-2, 3)$.

This is a quadratic function, which represents a parabola. In order for the quadratic expression to be positive, the parabola must lie above the x-axis. Hence, we are looking for two distinct real roots (i.e., the parabola intersects the x-axis at two different points).\n\nLet the roots of the quadratic be $r_1$ and $r_2$. We have three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: Both roots are less than -2\nIf $r_1<-2$ and $r_2<-2$, then the quadratic expression $x^2+bx+c>0$ will always be positive for all $x$. This implies that when $x< -2$, the quadratic expression is positive. However, this contradicts the given information that $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: One root is less than -2 and the other root is greater than 3\nIf $r_1< -2$ and $r_2>3$ (or the reverse, $r_1>3$ and $r_2< -2$), then the quadratic expression will be positive between these two roots, which is the interval $(-2, 3)$. However, this interval contradicts the given information that $x\\in (-\\infty, -2)\\cup(3,\\infty)$. Hence, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: Both roots are greater than 3\nTo ensure that the quadratic expression is positive when $x>3$, we need to consider a few conditions. Firstly, the quadratic expression should be positive at $x=3$ (since $3$ is included in the given range). This gives us the condition $3^2+3b+c>0$ or $9+3b+c>0$. Additionally, we need the quadratic expression to be greater than $0$ for $x>3$, which means the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ should fall outside the interval (-2, 3). In other words, both $r_1$ and $r_2$ should be greater than $3$. This implies that the discriminant of the quadratic, $b^2-4c$, should be negative.\n\nNow, let's find the discriminant of the quadratic. The discriminant, $D$, of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $D=b^2-4ac$. In this case, we have $a=1$ and the discriminant becomes:\n\n$b^2-4c<0$\nWe can rewrite this inequality as $4c>b^2$.\n\nCombining this inequality with the condition $9+3b+c>0$, we have the following system of inequalities to solve: \n\\[4c>b^2\\]\n\\[9+3b+c>0\\]\n\nLet's consider the inequality $4c>b^2$. Since we have no information about $b$ or $c$, we cannot say anything definitive about this inequality. Therefore, we move on to the second inequality.\n\nConsidering $9+3b+c>0$, we know that $3b+c>-9$. We also know that both $b$ and $c$ are integers. Since number theory is within our area of expertise, let's consider a few integer solutions $(b, c)$ to this inequality:\n\nFor $b=-3$ and $c=-8$, we have $3b+c=-9$, which satisfies the inequality. However, this solution does not guarantee that the quadratic expression is positive for $x>3$. Therefore, we need to consider a larger value of $b$.\n\nFor $b=0$ and $c=1$, we have $3b+c=1$, which satisfies the inequality. Moreover, when we plug these values into the condition $9+3b+c>0$, we obtain $9+0+1=10>0$, which means the quadratic expression is positive at $x=3$.
