{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$.\n\nLet's start by considering the prime factorization of $n$. Since the product of the positive divisors of $n$ is $n^6$, we know that the prime factorization of $n$ must have the form $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ are positive integers.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the positive divisors of $n$. Each divisor of $n$ can be written in the form $p_1^{b_1}p_2^{b_2}\\cdots p_k^{b_k}$, where $0 \\le b_i \\le a_i$ for each $i$. Thus, the product of the positive divisors can be written as\n\\[(p_1^0p_1^1\\cdots p_1^{a_1})(p_2^0p_2^1\\cdots p_2^{a_2})\\cdots(p_k^0p_k^1\\cdots p_k^{a_k}).\\]\nUsing the properties of exponents, this can be simplified to\n\\[(p_1^{0+1+\\cdots+a_1})(p_2^{0+1+\\cdots+a_2})\\cdots(p_k^{0+1+\\cdots+a_k}).\\]\nThis further simplifies to\n\\[p_1^{a_1(a_1+1)/2}p_2^{a_2(a_2+1)/2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k(a_k+1)/2}.\\]\n\nNow, we want this product to equal $n^6$. Substituting the prime factorization of $n$ into the equation, we get\n\\[p_1^{a_1(a_1+1)/2}p_2^{a_2(a_2+1)/2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k(a_k+1)/2} = (p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k})^6.\\]\nUsing the properties of exponents again, this can be rewritten as\n\\[p_1^{a_1(a_1+1)/2}p_2^{a_2(a_2+1)/2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k(a_k+1)/2} = p_1^{6a_1}p_2^{6a_2}\\cdots p_k^{6a_k}.\\]\n\nSince the prime factors $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$ are distinct, we can equate the exponents. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\\[\\frac{a_1(a_1+1)}{2} = 6a_1,\\]\n\\[\\frac{a_2(a_2+1)}{2} = 6a_2,\\]\n\\[\\vdots\\]\n\\[\\frac{a_k(a_k+1)}{2} = 6a_k.\\]\n\nSimplifying each equation, we get\n\\[a_1^2 + a_1 - 12a_1 = 0,\\]\n\\[a_2^2 + a_2 - 12a_2 = 0,\\]\n\\[\\vdots\\]\n\\[a_k^2 + a_k - 12a_k = 0.\\]\n\nEvery equation can be factored as $a_i(a_i+4) = 0$. This means that for each prime factor $p_i$, we have either $a_i = 0$ or $a_i = -4$. However, $a_i$ represents the exponent of $p_i$ in the prime factorization of $n$, so it must be a positive integer. Therefore, we cannot have $a_i = -4$.\n\nThe only remaining option is $a_i = 0$. This means that every prime factor $p_i$ must be raised to the power of $0$ in the prime factorization of $n$. In other words, $n$ is a product of distinct prime factors raised to the power of $0$.
