We can split this problem into cases based on the number of false answers. \n\nCase 1: Exactly $3$ false answers.\nIn this case, we need to choose $3$ out of the $10$ questions to be answered with a false, and the remaining $7$ questions should be answered with a true. The number of ways to select $3$ questions out of $10$ is denoted as $\\binom{10}{3}$. For each selection of questions, there is only one possible arrangement of the true/false answers.

Each question can be answered in 2 ways (true or false), so there are 2^10 = 1024 possible ways to answer the test.\n\nNext, let's find the number of ways where fewer than 3 questions are answered with false.\n\n- If all 10 questions are answered with true, there is only 1 way to do so.\n- If exactly 1 question is answered with false, there are 10 ways to choose the question to be answered falsely.
