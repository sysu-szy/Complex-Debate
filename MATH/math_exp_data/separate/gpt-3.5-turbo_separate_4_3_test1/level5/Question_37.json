Therefore, we can safely divide both sides by 1:\n\n$\\frac{24b}{1} \\equiv \\frac{1}{1} \\pmod{\\frac{121}{1}}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$24b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}$\n\nNext, we will find the modular inverse of 24 modulo 121. The modular inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$.\n\nTo find the modular inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Applying the Euclidean algorithm, we find:\n\n$121 = 5 \\cdot 24 + 1$\n\nStep 2: Rewriting the equation in terms of remainders, we have:\n\n$1 = 121 - 5 \\cdot 24$\n\nStep 3: Observe that the remainder 1 is the GCD of 24 and 121. Therefore, the linear combination:\n\n$1 = 121 - 5 \\cdot 24$\n\nimplies that:\n\n$1 \\equiv -5 \\cdot 24 \\pmod{121}$\n\nThus, $-5$ is the inverse of 24 modulo 121.\n\nSince we want the residue to be between 0 and $11^2-1$ (inclusive), we can add or subtract multiples of 121 until we obtain a residue in that range.\n\nThus, $b = -5 + 121 = 116$ is the residue that satisfies $24b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11^2}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{116}$."}]}
