Let's focus on maximizing this term.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the given equation: $xy + (x+y) = 454$. Rearranging, we have $xy = 454 - (x + y)$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression, we get $(x+y)(xy) = (x+y)(454 - (x + y))$.\n\nExpanding this expression gives us $(x+y)(454 - (x + y)) = (x+y) * 454 - (x+y)^2$.\n\nTo maximize $(x+y)^2$, we want to maximize $x+y$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x+y$ must be the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to $454$. Therefore, $x+y = 454$.\n\nSubstituting this value into our expression $(x+y)(454 - (x + y))$, we get $(454)(454 - (454)) = (454)(0) = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nHence, the correct answer to the problem is $\\boxed{0}$, indicating that the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product is zero."}]}
