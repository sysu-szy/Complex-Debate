{"question": "An Internet service provider allows a certain number of free hours each month and then charges for each additional hour used. Wells, Ted, and Vino each have separate accounts.

Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.
