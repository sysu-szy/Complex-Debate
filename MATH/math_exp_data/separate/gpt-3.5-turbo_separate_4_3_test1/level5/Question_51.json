Substituting this into the given equation, we get\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = (a(ax + b) + b) + (ax + b) = a^2 x + (2ab + 2b).\\]Comparing this to $6x,$ we see that $a^2 = 6$ and $2ab + 2b = 0.$ The second equation factors as $2b(a + 1) = 0.$ If $b = 0,$ then $P(x) = ax,$ which is not a valid solution (since $P(0) = 0$), so we must have $a = -1.$ Therefore, $P(x) = -x + b.$\n\nSubstituting $P(x) = -x + b$ into the given equation, we get\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = -(-x + b) + (-x + b) = 2x + 2b = 6x.\\]Thus, $b = 3.$\n\nTherefore, $P(x) = -x + 3,$ so $P(10) = -7.$ Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $P(10)$ is $\\boxed{-7}.$", "round 1": "After analyzing the given equation $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x,$ we can conclude that the only possible degree for the polynomial $P(x)$ is $1.$\n\nLet $P(x) = ax + b,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Substituting this into the equation, we get $(a(ax + b) + b) + (ax + b) = 6x.$ Simplifying, we have $a^2 x + (2a + 1) b = 6x.$\n\nWe now have the equations $a^2 = 6$ and $(2a + 1) b = 0.$ From $a^2 = 6,$ we find that $a = \\pm \\sqrt{6}.$\n\nFor the case $a = \\sqrt{6},$ we have $(2\\sqrt{6} + 1) b = 0,$ which gives us $b = 0.$ Therefore, one possible polynomial is $P(x) = \\sqrt{6} x.$ Plugging in $x = 10,$ we find $P(10) = \\sqrt{6} \\cdot 10 = 10\\sqrt{6}.$\n\nFor the case $a = -\\sqrt{6},$ we have $(2(-\\sqrt{6}) + 1) b = 0,$ which gives us $b = 0.$ Therefore, another possible polynomial is $P(x) = -\\sqrt{6} x.$ Plugging in $x = 10,$ we find $P(10) = -\\sqrt{6} \\cdot 10 = -10\\sqrt{6}.$\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $P(10)$ is $10\\sqrt{6} + (-10\\sqrt{6}) = \\boxed{0}.$", "round 2": "After analyzing the given equation $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x,$ we can conclude that the polynomial $P(x)$ must be linear. Let's assume $P(x) = ax + b,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n\nSubstituting $P(x) = ax + b$ into the equation, we get\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = (a(ax + b) + b) + (ax + b) = a^2 x + (2ab + 2b).\\]\n\nComparing this expression to $6x,$ we see that $a^2 = 6$ and $2ab + 2b = 0.$ \n\nFrom $a^2 = 6,$ we find two possible values for $a,$ namely $a = \\sqrt{6}$ and $a = -\\sqrt{6}.$\n\nConsidering $2ab + 2b = 0,$ we substitute the values of $a$ and solve for $b.$\n\nIf $a = \\sqrt{6},$ we have $2(\\sqrt{6})b + 2b = 0,$ which simplifies to $2b(\\sqrt{6} + 1) = 0.$ This equation is satisfied if $b = 0$ or $\\sqrt{6} + 1 = 0.$ However, $\\sqrt{6}$ is positive, so $\\sqrt{6} + 1$ is never zero.
