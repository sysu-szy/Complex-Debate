Therefore, the correct coordinates of point $A$ are $(6, 2\\sqrt{6})$. \n\nSimilarly, point $B$ has coordinates $(6, -2\\sqrt{6})$. \n\nNow, we can find the length $AB$ using the distance formula: \n\n\\begin{align*}\nAB &= \\sqrt{(6 - 6)^2 + (2\\sqrt{6} - (-2\\sqrt{6}))^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{0 + (4\\sqrt{6})^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{0 + 96} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{96} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{4\\sqrt{6}}.\n\\end{align*}", "round 2": "To solve this problem, let's find the equations of the tangents from $(1,3)$ to the parabola $y^2 = 4x$. Since the point $(1,3)$ lies above the $x$-axis, the tangents will intersect the parabola at two distinct points $A$ and $B$.\n\nLet $y = mx + c$ be the equation of a general tangent from $(1,3)$. Substituting this into the equation $y^2 = 4x$, we get $(mx + c)^2 = 4x$.\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we have $m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 4x = 0$. This quadratic equation in $x$ must have two equal roots for the tangent line to be a tangent, so the discriminant must be 0.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation is $4m^2c^2 - 4(m^2 + 1)(c^2 - 4) = 0$. Simplifying, we get $4m^2c^2 - 4c^2m^2 - 16m^2 - 16 = 0$.\n\nSimplifying further, we have $(-16m^2 - 16) = 0$, which gives $m^2 = -1$.\n\nSince $m^2 = -1$, there are no real values of $m$ that satisfy this equation. This means that no tangent can be drawn from the point $(1,3)$ to the parabola $y^2 = 4x$.\n\nTherefore, the length of $AB$ is undefined. \n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{undefined}}$."}]}
