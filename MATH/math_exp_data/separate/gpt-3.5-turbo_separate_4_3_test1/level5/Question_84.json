The larger circular face has a radius of 10 cm and the smaller circular face has a radius of 4 cm.\n\nThe formulas for the circumferences of circles are:\n\nCircumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\nC1 = 2 * \u03c0 * r1 = 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm = 20 * \u03c0 cm\nC2 = 2 * \u03c0 * r2 = 2 * \u03c0 * 4 cm = 8 * \u03c0 cm\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of L, C1, and C2 into the formula for the lateral surface area and calculate:\n\nLateral Surface Area = (1/2) * L * (C1 + C2)\n= (1/2) * 10 cm * (20 * \u03c0 cm + 8 * \u03c0 cm)\n= 5 * 28 * \u03c0 cm^2\n= 140 * \u03c0 cm^2\n\nNext, we need to calculate the areas of the two circular bases. \nThe formulas for the areas of circles are:\n\nArea = \u03c0 * radius^2\n\nA1 = \u03c0 * r1^2 = \u03c0 * 10 cm^2 = 100 * \u03c0 cm^2\nA2 = \u03c0 * r2^2 = \u03c0 * 4 cm^2 = 16 * \u03c0 cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area by adding the lateral surface area and the areas of the two circular bases:\n\nTotal Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + A1 + A2\n= 140 * \u03c0 cm^2 + 100 * \u03c0 cm^2 + 16 * \u03c0 cm^2\n= (140 + 100 + 16) * \u03c0 cm^2\n= 256 * \u03c0 cm^2\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the frustum is \\boxed{256\u03c0} square centimeters.", "round 2": "To find the lateral surface area of the frustum, we can use the formula:\n\nLateral Surface Area = (1/2) * L * (C1 + C2)\n\nwhere L is the slant height, C1 is the circumference of the larger circular face, and C2 is the circumference of the smaller circular face.\n\nFirst, let's find the slant height L by using the Pythagorean theorem. From the given diagram, we can see that L forms a right triangle with the height of the frustum (8 cm) and the difference in radii of the two circular faces (10 cm - 4 cm = 6 cm). So, we have:\n\nL^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 100\nL = \u221a100 = 10 cm\n\nNext, let's find the circumferences of the two circular faces. The larger circular face has a radius of 10 cm, so its circumference C1 is:\n\nC1 = 2\u03c0(10) = 20\u03c0 cm\n\nThe smaller circular face has a radius of 4 cm, so its circumference C2 is:\n\nC2 = 2\u03c0(4) = 8\u03c0 cm\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the lateral surface area:\n\nLateral Surface Area = (1/2) * 10 cm * (20\u03c0 cm + 8\u03c0 cm)\n= 5 * 28\u03c0 cm^2\n= 140\u03c0 cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the areas of the two circular bases. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = \u03c0 * radius^2\n\nThe larger circular base has a radius of 10 cm, so its area is:\n\nA1 = \u03c0(10)^2 = 100\u03c0 cm^2\n\nThe smaller circular base has a radius of 4 cm, so its area is:\n\nA2 = \u03c0(4)^2 = 16\u03c0 cm^2\n\nFinally, we can find the total surface area of the frustum by adding the lateral surface area and the areas of the two circular bases:\n\nTotal Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + A1 + A2\n= 140\u03c0 cm^2 + 100\u03c0 cm^2 + 16\u03c0 cm^2\n= (140 + 100 + 16)\u03c0 cm^2\n= 256\u03c0 cm^2\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the frustum is \\boxed{256\u03c0} square centimeters."}]}
