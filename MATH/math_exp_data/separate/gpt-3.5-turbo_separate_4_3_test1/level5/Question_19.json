Roslyn reads at 360 words per minute, so it takes her $\\frac{252000}{360} = 700$ minutes to read the book.

Since the book has 420 pages with an average of 600 words per page, we can multiply these two numbers: 420 pages * 600 words/page = 252,000 words.\n\nNext, we can find how many minutes it took Roslyn to read the book by dividing the total number of words by her reading rate. So, 252,000 words / 360 words/minute = 700 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes into hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. So, 700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 11.67 hours.\n\nSince the question asks us to express the answer as a mixed number, we can write the final answer as 11 hours and 40 minutes, which is equal to 11 + 40/60 = 11 + 2/3 = 11 \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}} hours.", "round 1": "To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
