{"question": "Two weeks ago, Alice came home from vacation and noticed that a bean plant was growing in her garden. Today, the stalk is $452$ centimeters tall, and Alice observed that its height increases by $5\\%$ every day.  How tall was the plant $2$ weeks ago when she first noticed it growing? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.", "answer": "One week is equal to $7$ days, and the plant grows by $5\\%$ each day.  We can work backwards to find the previous size of the plant.  We can reverse the compound interest formula to solve this problem, as if the plant loses five percent of its height every day for $14$ days.  So the height of the plant two weeks ago is equal to $$452\\div(1+0.05)^{14}= 452\\div1.98=228.29$$So, the bean plant was $\\boxed{228.3}$ centimeters tall when Alice first found it.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's first determine how many days have passed from two weeks ago to today.

This means that the plant grew for $14$ days.\n\nAlice observed that the height of the plant increases by $5\\%$ every day. To find the height of the plant two weeks ago, we need to determine what fraction of the current height represents the height increase each day. \n\nLet's consider the first day Alice observed the plant. Since the height increases by $5\\%$ each day, the height of the plant two weeks ago would be $100\\% - 5\\% = 95\\%$ of today's height. \n\nTo calculate this, we can use the concept of percentages. The current height of the plant is $452$ centimeters. To find $95\\%$ of $452$, we multiply $452$ by $0.95$.\n\nTherefore, the height of the plant two weeks ago, when Alice first noticed it growing, is $452 \\times 0.95 = 429.4$ centimeters, rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nThus, the plant was approximately $\\boxed{429.4}$ centimeters tall two weeks ago.", "round 1": "Let's examine the given information and reasoning from the other agents.\n\nWe are told that the height of the plant increases by $5\\%$ every day.
