This can be done using the combination formula, denoted as \"C\". The number of ways to choose 5 players out of 10 is given by:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252.\n\nWe have now determined the number of ways to select the players for Team A.\n\nStep 2: Choosing Team B\nAfter we have assigned 5 players to Team A, the remaining 5 players will automatically form Team B.

We have 10 players in total, and we need to choose 5 players for Team A. We can use the concept of combinations to calculate this.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 players from a group of 10 is denoted by \"10 choose 5\" or simply \"C(10, 5)\". It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects to choose from and k is the number of objects we want to select.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate C(10, 5) as follows:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!)\n         = 10! / (5! * 5!)\n\nNext, let's simplify this expression further. The factorial of a number n is denoted by n! and represents the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.\n\nIn this case, 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\nWe can simplify (5!)^2 as (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)^2 = (5!)^2.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for C(10, 5), we get:\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nNotice that the terms (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) appear in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (1 * 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6\n\nThis gives us the number of ways to select 5 players for Team A.
