Let's denote the new error in the measurement of position as $y$.\n\nSubstituting the new values into the inequality, we have:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{p}{2}\\right)y \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}\\]\n\nTo find the percentage change in the minimum error in the measurement of position, we need to calculate the percentage change between $x$ and $y$ and express it as a percentage of $x$.\n\nLet's solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ by rearranging the inequality:\n\\[y \\geq \\frac{h}{2\\pi p}\\]\n\nThe percentage change can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{y - x}{x} \\times 100\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of $y$ and $x$ into the formula, we have:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{2\\pi p} - x}{x} \\times 100\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets, we get:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h - 2\\pi px}{2\\pi p}}{x} \\times 100\\]\n\nNext, let's simplify this expression further. Multiplying the numerator by $\\frac{1}{p}$ and simplifying, we have:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{2\\pi p} - 2x}{x} \\times 100\\]\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $2\\pi$, we get:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{p} - 4\\pi x}{2\\pi x} \\times 100\\]\n\nLet's simplify this expression further. Combining the terms inside the brackets, we have:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{p} - 4\\pi x}{2\\pi x} \\times 100\\]\n\nTo merge the two fractions in the numerator, we can find a common denominator of $2\\pi p$:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{p} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi p}{2\\pi p} - 4\\pi x}{2\\pi x} \\times 100\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{2\\pi h - 4\\pi px}{2\\pi x} \\times 100\\]\n\nFactoring out $2\\pi$ from the numerator, we have:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{2\\pi (h - 2px)}{2\\pi x} \\times 100\\]\n\nCanceling out the common factor of $2\\pi$ in the numerator and denominator, we get:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{h - 2px}{x} \\times 100\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position increases by $\\boxed{\\frac{h - 2px}{x} \\times 100\\%}$.\n\nThe expression $\\frac{h - 2px}{x}$ is the final answer after simplification."}]}
