So if we start with a large $x,$ then trying to make $x^4 + 1$ negative might make the entire expression small.  But the expression contains a factor of $x,$ so if we try to make $x$ negative, then the expression will become large.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to look at the behavior of the expression as a function of $x.$  We can compute partial derivatives, but before we do that, let's make the expression easier to work with.  We can do this by dividing the expression by $x^4.$  (This does not change the location of the minimum.)\n\nNow, we have the expression\n\\[\\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z x^4}.\\]Since we are dividing by $x^4,$ the new expression actually looks nicer when $x$ is small, instead of when $x$ is large.  (Recall that we were trying to make $x$ negative at first.)  Thus, it makes sense to let $x$ be small.\n\nNow, let $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z x^4}.$  Note that $f>0$ for all positive $x,$ $y,$ $z$ since all of the factors are positive.\n\nBy the AM-GM inequality,\n\\[\\frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 3}{4} \\ge \\sqrt[4]{x^4 y^4 z^4} = xyz,\\]so\n\\[\\frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4}{3} \\ge xyz.\\]This tells us that\n\\[3(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1) \\ge (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 3)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1) \\ge 4xy^2 z(x^4 + y^4 + z^4).\\]Therefore,\n\\[f(x,y,z) \\ge \\frac{4xy^2 z(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)}{xy^2 z x^4} = \\frac{4(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)}{x^3}.\\]So to get the minimum, we want to make $\\frac{4(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)}{x^3}$ as small as possible.\n\nAgain, we want $x$ to be small, so let's look at a small value of $x.$  For example, if $x = \\frac{1}{2},$ then the expression becomes\n\\[\\frac{4 \\left( \\frac{1}{16} + y^4 + z^4 \\right)}{\\frac{1}{8}} = 32 \\left( \\frac{1}{32} + 2(2y)^4 + 2(2z)^4 \\right) = 32 \\left( \\frac{1}{32} + u^4 + v^4 \\right),\\]where $u = 2y$ and $v = 2z.$\n\nIf $u$ and $v$ can be negative, then this expression can be made arbitrarily small.  Otherwise, recall that we at one point considered trying to make $x^4 + 1$ negative.  We can do this by letting $x$ be a small negative number, say $x = -\\frac{1}{2}.$  Then the expression becomes\n\\[\\frac{4 \\left( \\frac{1}{16} + 1 + y^4 + z^4 \\right)}{\\frac{-1}{8}} = -32 \\left( \\frac{1}{32} - u^4 - v^4 \\right).\\]By the same reasoning, this expression can be made arbitrarily small if $u$ and $v$ can be positive.\n\nIn some sense, we have proven that the expression can be made arbitrarily small.  To actually find the minimum, by setting $u = v = 0,$ we find that the minimum value is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nFinally, note that the expression is never negative, because all factors in $(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)$ are nonnegative.", "round 1": "Rewriting the expression $\\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z},$ we have\n\\[\\frac{x^4 y^4 z^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{x^4 y^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{x^4 z^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{y^4 z^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{x^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{y^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{z^4}{xy^2 z} + \\frac{1}{xy^2 z}.\\]We want to make this expression as small as possible.\n\nBy the AM-GM inequality,\n\\[\\frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 3}{4} \\ge \\sqrt[4]{x^4 y^4 z^4} = xyz,\\]so\n\\[\\frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4}{3} \\ge xyz.\\]This tells us that\n\\[3(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1) \\ge (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 3)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1) \\ge 4xy^2 z(x^4 + y^4 + z^4).\\]Therefore,\n\\[\\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z} \\ge \\frac{4(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)}{x^3}.\\]To minimize the expression, we want to make $\\frac{4(x^4 + y^4 + z^4)}{x^3}$ as small as possible.\n\nBy setting $x = y = z$ and evaluating the expression, we find that $x^4 = y^4 = z^4 = 1,$ so the expression is $4 \\cdot 3 = 12.$\n\nFinally, we can express $12$ as $\\frac{12 \\sqrt{1}}{1},$ so $a + b + c = \\boxed{13}.$", "round 2": "From the previous solutions, it has been established that the expression $\\frac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z}$ can be made arbitrarily small, approaching $0$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression is $0$.\n\nHence, the final answer is $\\boxed{0}$."}, {"round 0": "First, let's attempt expanding the expression and simplifying it.
