Let's rework the problem correctly:\n\nWe are given that the airplane climbs 100 feet in the first second, then climbs an additional 100 feet in each successive second. We need to find the number of seconds it takes for the airplane to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height.\n\nLet's denote the number of seconds it takes for the plane to reach the desired altitude as \"n\". We can set up the following equation based on the given information:\n\n100 + 100(1) + 100(2) + ... + 100(n) = 12,000\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can factor out 100 from each term:\n\n100(1 + 1 + 2 + ... + n) = 12,000\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the first n natural numbers, which can be expressed as the arithmetic series formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (n/2)(1 + n)\n\nSubstituting this into our equation, we get:\n\n100 * (n/2)(1 + n) = 12,000\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n50n(1 + n) = 12,000\n\nExpanding the multiplication on the left side:\n\n50n + 50n^2 = 12,000\n\nRearranging the equation into standard quadratic form:\n\n50n^2 + 50n - 12,000 = 0\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 50 to simplify:\n\nn^2 + n - 240 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula. Let's use factoring in this case:\n\n(n + 16)(n - 15) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we obtain:\n\nn + 16 = 0 -> n = -16\n\nn - 15 = 0 -> n = 15\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the airplane takes 15 seconds to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height.\n\nHence, the updated and correct answer is \\boxed{15}."}]}
