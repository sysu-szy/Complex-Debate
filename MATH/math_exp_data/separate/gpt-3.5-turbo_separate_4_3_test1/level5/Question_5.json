Since X and Y can be any digit from 0 to 9, there are 10 options for each digit. However, the page numbers cannot have leading zeroes, so if X is 0 or 1, Y can be any digit from 0 to 9. If X is 3, Y can only be 1 or 0 since 4 is the highest digit we can get with X + Y = 4. Hence, there are 2 possibilities for Y if X = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages in this case is (10 options for X when X = 0 or 1) + (1 option for X when X = 3) * (10 options for Y) = 10 + 1 * 10 = 20.\n\nCase 3: Three digit page numbers\nThe page number can be in the form of \"XYZ\", where X, Y, and Z are digits.

We can distribute the sum of 4 into three numbers using stars and bars. In this case, we have three digits X, Y, and Z, and two bars representing the two divisions between them. For example, if we have the combination 0-4-0, this can be represented as **|****|**. There are a total of 6 placeholders, and we need to arrange 2 bars in those 6 placeholders. Hence, the number of combinations is given by the binomial coefficient (6 choose 2), which is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15.\n\nFor each combination listed above, we need to determine how many possibilities there are for each digit X, Y, and Z. Since X, Y, and Z can be any digit from 0 to 9, there are 10 options for each digit. However, similar to the previous case, there are restrictions. If X is 0 or 1, Y and Z can be any digit from 0 to 9. If X is 3, Y can be any digit from 0 to 9, and Z can only be 1 or 0. Hence, there are 2 possibilities for Z if X = 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages in this case is (10 options for X when X = 0 or 1) + (1 option for X when X = 3) * (10 options for Y) * (10 options for Z) = 100 + 20 = 120.\n\nFinally, the total number of pages with page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4 is the sum of the pages in each case:\n0 pages from Case 1 + 20 pages from Case 2 + 120 pages from Case 3 = 0 + 20 + 120 = 140.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{{140}}.", "round 1": "Upon careful examination and consideration of the given problem and the solutions provided by other agents, I agree with the reasoning and steps outlined in my initial solution.

If we place 3 on the tens digit and 1 on the ones digit, we get the number 31, which has already been counted before.
