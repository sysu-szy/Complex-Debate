Therefore, we can write the equations for points $A$ and $C$ as $(a, a^2)$ and $(-c, c^2)$, respectively, where $a$ and $c$ are real numbers.\n\nSince $OABC$ is a rectangle, the opposite sides must be parallel. This means that the slope between $O$ and $A$ must be the same as the slope between $C$ and $B$.\n\nThe slope between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by\n\n$$\\text{slope} = \\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.$$\n\nUsing this formula, the slope of $OA$ is $\\dfrac{a^2 - 0}{a - 0} = a$, and the slope of $BC$ is $\\dfrac{b^2 - c^2}{b - (-c)} = \\dfrac{b^2 - c^2}{b + c}$.\n\nSince $OA$ and $BC$ are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, we have\n\n$$a = \\dfrac{b^2 - c^2}{b + c}.$$\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by $b + c$ to eliminate the denominator:\n\n$$a(b + c) = b^2 - c^2.$$\n\nExpanding both sides gives\n\n$$ab + ac = b^2 - c^2.$$\n\nNext, let's consider the coordinates of vertex $B$. Since $B$ lies on the $x$-axis, its $y$-coordinate is 0. Therefore, point $B$ has coordinates $(b, 0)$.\n\nSubstituting these coordinates into the equation $y = x^2$, we get\n\n$$0 = b^2.$$\n\nThis tells us that $b = 0$. Therefore, we can substitute $b = 0$ into the equation involving $a, b,$ and $c$ that we found earlier:\n\n$$a(0) + ac = 0^2 - c^2 \\implies ac = -c^2.$$\n\nSince the expression on the right-hand side is a quadratic expression, let's write it in standard form:\n\n$$c^2 + ac = 0.$$\n\nFinally, let's make one more observation. If $a = 0$, then equation $(1)$ becomes $0 = 0^2 - c^2$, which implies $0 = -c^2$. The only way this can hold true is if $c = 0$.\n\nTherefore, if $a = 0$, then $c = 0$, which means that points $A$ and $C$ coincide at the origin $O$. In this case, the rectangle $OABC$ degenerates to a line segment $OC$ and vertex $B$ does not lie on any parabola.\n\nHowever, if $a \\neq 0$, then we can divide both sides of equation $(1)$ by $c$ (since we cannot divide by 0), giving us\n\n$$c + a = 0,$$\n\nor equivalently, $c = -a$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of points $A$ and $C$ are $(a, a^2)$ and $(-a, a^2)$, respectively.\n\nSince vertex $B$ lies on the $x$-axis at $(b, 0)$, we have $b = 0$. \n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n- If $a = 0$, then $c = 0$, and the rectangle degenerates to a line segment $OC$ with vertex $B$ not lying on any parabola.\n- If $a \\neq 0$, then $b = 0$, and the coordinates of points $A, B,$ and $C$ are $(a, a^2), (0, 0),$ and $(-a, a^2)$, respectively.\n\nWe can now substitute these coordinates into the general equation of a parabola $y = px^2 + qx + r$ to find the specific equation for the fixed parabola that vertex $B$ lies on.\n\nUsing point $A$:\n\n$$a^2 = pa^2 + qa + r.$$\n\nUsing point $C$:\n\n$$a^2 = p(-a)^2 + q(-a) + r = pa^2 - qa + r.$$\n\nSince these equations hold for all values of $a$, the coefficients must be equal:\n\n$$\\begin{cases} p = 1 \\\\ q = 0 \\\\ r = 0 \\end{cases}.$$\n\nTherefore, the equation for the fixed parabola that vertex $B$ lies on is $\\boxed{y = x^2}$.", "round 1": "First, we analyze the relationship between the rectangle $OABC$ and the parabola $y = x^2$.
