Our goal is to find the length of median $\\overline{QM}$.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{QM}$, we can use the properties of a median in a triangle. The median of a triangle is a line segment that connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, $\\overline{QM}$ is the median of $\\triangle PQR$ and connects vertex $Q$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{PR}$.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{QM}$, we need to find the length of $\\overline{PR}$.

Therefore, $\\triangle RPQ$ is also an isosceles triangle with $RP=PQ=34$.\n\nSince medians in an isosceles triangle bisect each other, we know that $\\overline{MN}$ is half the length of $\\overline{PQ}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\overline{MN} = \\frac{34}{2} = 17$.\n\nSince $\\overline{PR}=32$ and $\\overline{MN}=17$, we can find the length of $\\overline{QN}$ by subtracting $\\overline{MN}$ from $\\overline{PQ}$:\n\n$\\overline{QN} = \\overline{PQ} - \\overline{MN} = 34 - 17 = 17$.\n\nFinally, since $\\overline{QN}$ and $\\overline{QM}$ are both medians in $\\triangle PQR$, they must be congruent.
