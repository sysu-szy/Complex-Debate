{"question": "I have a bag with yellow and blue marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. If I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 7:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I added more?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$. Additionally, after we add blue marbles and remove yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be x+5 and y-3 respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $7:3$, so $\\dfrac{x+5}{y-3}=\\dfrac{7}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $3x=4y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x+5)=7(y-3)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=12$, $x=16$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before more were added, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{16}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the number of blue marbles initially in the bag is represented by the variable 'x', and the number of yellow marbles initially in the bag is represented by the variable 'y'.\n\nAccording to the problem, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is initially 4:3. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nEquation 1: x/y = 4/3\n\nNext, the problem states that if we add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 7:3. So, after these changes, we have (x+5) blue marbles and (y-3) yellow marbles. We can write the second equation based on this scenario:\n\nEquation 2: (x+5)/(y-3) = 7/3\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nTo eliminate fractions, we can multiply both sides of Equation 1 by 3 and both sides of Equation 2 by (y-3).
