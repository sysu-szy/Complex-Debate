We know that every third positive integer is divisible by 3. This means that out of the first 500 positive integers, there are 500/3 (rounded down to the nearest whole number) that are divisible by 3. Thus, there are 166 positive integers divisible by 3.\n\nNext, let's consider the numbers divisible by 4. Every fourth positive integer is divisible by 4. Hence, the number of positive integers divisible by 4 is 500/4 (rounded down to the nearest whole number), which results in 125 positive integers divisible by 4.\n\nFinally, let's consider the numbers divisible by 5. Similar to the previous cases, every fifth positive integer is divisible by 5. Therefore, we have a total of 500/5 (rounded down) positive integers divisible by 5, which corresponds to 100 positive integers.\n\nNow, to find the number of positive integers that are divisible by all three numbers (3, 4, and 5), we need to find the overlap among these sets. That is, we need to determine the number of positive integers that are divisible by both 3 and 4, by both 3 and 5, and by both 4 and 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of positive integers divisible by both 3 and 4. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4, which is 12. Every twelfth positive integer is divisible by both 3 and 4. Therefore, we have a total of 500/12 (rounded down) positive integers divisible by both 3 and 4, which is 41.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the number of positive integers divisible by both 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. Every fifteenth positive integer is divisible by both 3 and 5. Thus, there are 500/15 (rounded down) positive integers divisible by both 3 and 5, which is 33.\n\nFinally, let's find the number of positive integers divisible by both 4 and 5. The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. Every twentieth positive integer is divisible by both 4 and 5. Hence, we have 500/20 (rounded down) positive integers divisible by both 4 and 5, which is 25.\n\nNow, to find the number of positive integers divisible by all three numbers (3, 4, and 5), we need to find the overlap among these sets. If a number is divisible by all three numbers, it must be divisible by their LCM, which is 60. Every sixtieth positive integer is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.
