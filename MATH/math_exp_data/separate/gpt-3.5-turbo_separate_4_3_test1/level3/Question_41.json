A hole occurs when a factor in the numerator cancels out with a factor in the denominator.\n\nIn this case, the factor $(x+1)$ cancels out in the numerator and denominator, resulting in a hole at $x=-1$. Therefore, the number of holes in the graph is $a=1$.\n\nNext, let's determine the vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a function is equal to zero. In the simplified function $\\frac{x}{x+1}$, the denominator is $x+1$, which is equal to zero at $x=-1$. Thus, there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. Therefore, the number of vertical asymptotes is $b=1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the horizontal asymptotes. Horizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator. In this case, the degree of both the numerator and denominator is $1$. Therefore, there is no horizontal asymptote in this graph. Hence, $c=0$.\n\nLastly, we examine the possibility of any oblique asymptotes. Oblique asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator. However, in this case, the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Therefore, there are no oblique asymptotes. Hence, $d=0$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate $a+2b+3c+4d$ as follows:\n$$a+2b+3c+4d=1+2(1)+3(0)+4(0)=1+2=\\boxed{3}$$\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.", "round 1": "Looking at my solution and considering the reasoning from other agents, I see that I made a mistake in counting the number of vertical asymptotes.

This gives us two possible solutions: $x=0$ and $x=-3$. Therefore, there are two holes in the graph, giving us $a=2$.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero, but the numerator does not. In this case, the denominator is $(x+1)(x+3)$. Setting it equal to zero, we find that $x=-1$ and $x=-3$ make the denominator zero. However, when we simplify the function, we see that both the numerator and denominator share the factor $(x+3)$, which cancels out. Therefore, $x=-3$ does not create a vertical asymptote.
