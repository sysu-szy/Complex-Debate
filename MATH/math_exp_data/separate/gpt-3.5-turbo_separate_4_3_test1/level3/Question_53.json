{"question": "There exists a real number $k$ such that the equation\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} + s \\begin{pmatrix} -15 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\]has infinitely many solutions in $t$ and $s$.  Find $k$.", "answer": "As $t$ varies over all real numbers,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]takes on all points on a line with direction $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$, and as $s$ varies over all real numbers,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} + s \\begin{pmatrix} -15 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}\\]takes on all points on a line with direction $\\begin{pmatrix} -15 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSince the given equation has infinitely many solutions in $t$ and $s$, geometrically, it means that the two lines intersect at infinitely many points.  This is possible only if the lines coincide.  Note that this can occur, because the direction vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ of the first line is a scalar multiple of the direction vector $\\begin{pmatrix} -15 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}$ of the second line.\n\nSo to find $k$, we can set $s$ to be any particular value we like.  For convenience, we set $s = 0$.  Then\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}.\\]The left-hand side becomes\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 5t + 4 \\\\ 2t - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Then $5t + 4 = 8$ and $k = 2t - 1$.
