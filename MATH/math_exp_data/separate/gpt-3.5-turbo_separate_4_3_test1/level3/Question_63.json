Using the fact that opposite sides of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, we can conclude that $UV$ is perpendicular to $VW$ and $UW$ is perpendicular to $VR$. Since $U$, $V$, and $W$ are midpoints of the sides of $\\triangle PQR$, we can see that $UV \\parallel QR$ and $UW \\parallel PR$. Therefore, $\\triangle UVW$ is similar to $\\triangle PQR$.\n\nSince the ratio of the sides of two similar triangles is equal to the ratio of", "round 2": "To find the area of parallelogram $UVRW$, we can consider it as the difference between the areas of two triangles: $\\triangle PQR$ and $\\triangle STU$.\n\nLet's find the ratio of similarity between these triangles. Since $U$, $W$, and $V$ are midpoints of the sides of $\\triangle PQR$, they divide each side into two equal lengths. This means that $UV$ is parallel and equal in length to $PQ$, and $UW$ is parallel and equal in length to $QR$. Similarly, $VW$ is parallel and equal in length to $RP$. Therefore, the two triangles $\\triangle PQR$ and $\\triangle UVW$ are similar, with a ratio of similarity of $1:2$.\n\nSimilarly, $R$, $V$, and $W$ are midpoints of the sides of $\\triangle STU$, so they divide each side into two equal lengths. This means that $RV$ is parallel and equal in length to $TS$, $VW$ is parallel and equal in length to $SU$, and $WR$ is parallel and equal in length to $UT$. Again, the two triangles $\\triangle STU$ and $\\triangle RVW$ are similar, with a ratio of similarity of $1:2$.\n\nTherefore, the areas of $\\triangle PQR$, $\\triangle STU$, $\\triangle UVW$, and $\\triangle RVW$ have a ratio of $1:4$. Since the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $1$, the area of $\\triangle UVW$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the area of $\\triangle RVW$ is also $\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, the area of the parallelogram $UVRW$ is:\n\n$1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nTherefore, the area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."}]}
