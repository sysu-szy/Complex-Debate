Since each square has sides of length 6 units, the area of one square is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n\nNow, let's focus on the overlapping regions. There are two small squares that are formed at the corners where the three squares overlap. Each of these small squares has sides of length 3 units (half of 6 units). The area of each small square is 3 * 3 = 9 square units.\n\nNext, we need to consider the rectangular overlapping region in the middle. The length of this rectangle is 6 units (the side length of the large square) and the width is 3 units (half of the side length of the large square). Therefore, the area of the rectangular overlapping region is 6 * 3 = 18 square units.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total area of the overlapping regions. We have two small squares, each with an area of 9 square units, and one rectangular region with an area of 18 square units. So, the total area of the overlapping regions is 2 * 9 + 18 = 36 square units.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the gray figure by subtracting the total area of the overlapping regions from the total area of the three squares. The total area of the three squares is 3 * 36 = 108 square units.

The area of a square with side length 6 units is given by 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the overlapping region between two squares. Notice that the two middle squares share a common side, which means their overlapping region is a rectangle. The length of this rectangle is the same as the side length of the square, which is 6 units. The width of the rectangle can be found by subtracting the length of the non-overlapping segment (6 units) from the side length of the square (6 units). So the width of the rectangle is 6 - 6 = 0 units.\n\nThe area of this rectangle is then 6 * 0 = 0 square units.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the overlapping region between three squares. Two of the squares share an overlapped rectangle with 0 area, so we just need to find the area of the triangle that overlaps with the third square.\n\nNotice that this triangle is an isosceles triangle, where the base is the side length of the square (6 units) and the height is half the side length of the square (6/2 = 3 units). To find the area of this triangle, we use the formula: (base * height) / 2 = (6 * 3) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 square units.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the gray figure by subtracting the areas of the overlapping regions from the total area of the three squares.\n\nTotal area of three squares = 3 * 36 = 108 square units\nOverlap area = 0 + 9 = 9 square units\n\nArea of the gray figure = Total area - Overlap area = 108 - 9 = 99 square units\n\nThe area of the gray figure is \\boxed{99} square units.", "round 1": "After considering the solutions provided by other agents and examining the problem carefully, it appears that there was an error in the initial interpretation of the figure.

Since there are three identical squares, the total area of the squares is 3 * 36 = 108 square units.\n\nNow, let's determine the area of the white regions. Notice that the white regions are formed by the overlapping corners of the squares. Each corner is a quarter-circle with a radius of 3 units (half the length of the side of each square). Thus, the area of each quarter-circle is (1/4) * \u03c0 * 3^2 = (1/4) * \u03c0 * 9 = 9/4 * \u03c0 square units.\n\nAs there are four corners in total, the combined area of the white regions is 4 * (9/4 * \u03c0) = 9 * \u03c0 square units.\n\nFinally, to find the area of the gray figure, we subtract the area of the white regions from the total area of the squares.
