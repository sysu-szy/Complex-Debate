Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.

The volume of a ball is given by the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius of the ball.\n\nSince the diameter of the ball doubles, the radius of the ball is also doubled. Let's use R to represent the radius of the smaller ball (with diameter 6 inches) and 2R to represent the radius of the larger ball (with diameter 12 inches).\n\nThe volume of the smaller ball is V1 = (4/3)\u03c0R^3, and the volume of the larger ball is V2 = (4/3)\u03c0(2R)^3 = (32/3)\u03c0R^3.\n\nNow let's examine the relationship between the number of pairs of mittens and the volume of yarn required to make them. \n\nIt is given that she can knit one pair of mittens with a ball of yarn with a diameter of 6 inches.
