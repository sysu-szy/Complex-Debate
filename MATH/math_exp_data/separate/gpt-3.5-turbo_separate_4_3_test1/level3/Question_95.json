Therefore, the units digit of the difference is $2_7$. \n\nNext, let's subtract the digits in the sevens place. Here, we have $2_7 - 5_7$. However, $2_7$ in base $7$ is actually smaller than $5_7$ in base $7$. In base $7$, $2_7$ is equal to $2\\cdot7^0 = 2$. On the other hand, $5_7$ is equal to $5\\cdot7^0 = 5$. Since $2 < 5$, we need to borrow from the next place value.\n\nWhen we borrow, we take one from the next place value, which in this case is the $7$s place. In base $7$, we have $1_7\\cdot7 = 7_{10} = 10_7$. So we borrow $1_7$ and rewrite the $2_7$ in the $7$s place as $2_7 + 10_7 = 12_7$. \n\nSo now we have $12_7 - 5_7$.

We need to borrow from the leftmost digit. In this case, we need to borrow $1_7$ from the $7$s place and rewrite the $2_7$ as $12_7$. \n\nNow we have $12_7 - 5_7$.
