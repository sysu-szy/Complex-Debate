The center of the circle is $(0,0),$ and the radius $k$ determines the distance of each point on the circle from the origin.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation $xy=k.$ This equation represents a hyperbola in the $xy$-plane. If we rewrite the equation as $y=\\frac{k}{x},$ we can see that the hyperbola has two branches, one in the first and third quadrants and the other in the second and fourth quadrants. The vertical asymptotes of the hyperbola occur at $x=0,$ which means that the hyperbola never intersects the $y$-axis.\n\nTo determine where the two graphs intersect, we need to find the points that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Notice that for any valid point $(x,y)$ on the graph of the hyperbola, we have $x\\neq 0,$ since the equation $xy=k$ would be undefined if $x=0.$\n\nLet's analyze a few cases:\n\nCase 1: If $k=0,$ then the equation $xy=k$ reduces to $xy=0.$ The solutions to this equation are the $x$ and $y$-axes. However, the graph of $x^2+y^2=0^2$ is just the single point $(0,0).$ Therefore, in this case, the two graphs intersect at the point $(0,0),$ and $k=0$ is not a valid solution.\n\nCase 2: If $k\\neq 0,$ then we can divide the equation $xy=k$ by $k,$ obtaining $\\frac{xy}{k}=1.$ Now, we can substitute $xy=k$ into the equation $x^2+y^2=k^2,$ yielding $\\frac{xy}{k}+y^2=k^2.$ Rearranging, we have $y^2+\\frac{xy}{k}-k^2=0.$\n\nThis equation is quadratic in $y.$ Applying the quadratic formula, we get\n$$y = \\frac{-\\frac{x}{k}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2+4k^2}}{2} = \\frac{-\\frac{x}{k}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x^2+4k^2k^2}{k^2}}}{2}=\\frac{-\\frac{x}{k}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x^2+4k^4}{k^2}}}{2}.$$\n\nTo simplify further, notice that $x^2+y^2=k^2$ implies that $\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2=1.$ Hence, $\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2=\\frac{y^2}{k^2}=1-\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2,$ and we can replace $\\frac{x}{k}$ in our expression for $y$:\n$$y=\\frac{-\\frac{x}{k}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x^2+4k^4}{k^2}}}{2}$$\n$$=\\frac{-\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2}}{2}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+4k^4}}{2k}.$$\n\nAt this point, it might seem a bit challenging to analyze the solutions for different values of $k.$ However, we can simplify the expression in terms of $y$ only. Squaring both sides and rearranging, we obtain\n$$4y^2 - x^2 = 1-\\left(\\frac{x^2+4k^4}{k^2}\\right)=1-\\frac{x^2}{k^2}-4k^2.$$\n\nNow, notice that this equation holds for all $x$ and $y$ satisfying both the equation of the hyperbola $xy=k$ and the equation of the circle $x^2+y^2=k^2.$ Hence, the left-hand side represents the variation of the expression $4y^2 - x^2$ as we move through all valid points that satisfy both equations.\n\nWe can rewrite the left-hand side in terms of $y$ by noting that $\\frac{x}{y}$ can be resolved from the equation $xy=k$ to give $\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{k}{y},$ since $y\\neq 0.$ We have:\n$$4y^2 - x^2 = 4y^2 - \\left(\\frac{k}{y}\\right)^2 = 4y^2 - \\frac{k^2}{y^2}.$$\n\nNow, substituting the equation $\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2=1$ gives $\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2=1-\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2,$ which implies that $\\frac{k^2}{y^2}=k^2-\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2.$ Hence, we have:\n$$4y^2 - x^2 = 4y^2 - (k^2-\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2)=4y^2-k^2+\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right)^2=4y^2-k^2+k^2-4k^2.$$\n\nSimplifying further, we obtain:\n$$4y^2 - x^2 = 4y^2 - 4k^2.$$\n\nThis equation simplifies to $x^2=4k^2.$ Taking the square root of both sides, we have $x=\\pm 2k.$\n\nNow we have two potential solutions for each $k.$ The first is given by $y=\\frac{-\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2}}{2}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+4k^4}}{2k},$ which reduces to $y=\\frac{-1}{2}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{4k^2-1}}{2k}.$\n\nThe second solution is given by $y=\\frac{-\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{y}{k}\\right)^2}}{2}\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+4k^4}}{2k}.$ However, we note that the addition and subtraction do not affect the actual value of $y,$ meaning that we have identical solutions in the first and third quadrants.\n\nAnalyzing these solutions, we see that the equation has no solutions for $y$ whenever $\\sqrt{4k^2-1}$ is not real. Since $4k^2-1$ must be nonnegative (as it results from a square root), we obtain the inequality\n$$4k^2-1\\geq 0 \\implies |2k|\\geq 1.$$\n\nThis inequality can be written as $2k\\geq 1$ or $-2k\\geq 1,$ which simplify to $k\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ or $k\\leq -\\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nHaving analyzed the solutions thoroughly, we can conclude that the graphs of $x^2+y^2=k^2$ and $xy=k$ do not intersect when $k$ takes on any integer value between $k=\\boxed{-1}$ and $k=\\boxed{0},$ inclusive.", "round 1": "Upon reviewing the problem and considering the solutions provided by other agents, it becomes clear that my initial solution was incorrect.

This equation represents a circle centered at the origin with radius $k$.\n\nIn order for the graphs of these two equations to not intersect, the straight line and the circle must be tangent to each other.

We have $xy - k = 0$, which we can rewrite as $y = \\frac{k}{x}$. Notice that for the line to pass through the origin, we need $k = 0$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the tangent condition. When a line is tangent to a circle, it intersects the circle at exactly one point, which means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by combining both equations must be zero.\n\nSubstituting $y=\\frac{k}{x}$ into $x^2 + y^2 = k^2$, we get $x^2 + \\left(\\frac{k}{x}\\right)^2 = k^2$.
