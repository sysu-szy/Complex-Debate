The largest perfect square that divides evenly into $72$ is $36$. So we can write $\\sqrt{72}$ as $\\sqrt{36 \\cdot 2}$. Using the property $\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}$, we can split this square root as $\\sqrt{36} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$. The square root of $36$ is $6$, so now we have $6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNext, let's simplify $\\sqrt{10}$.
