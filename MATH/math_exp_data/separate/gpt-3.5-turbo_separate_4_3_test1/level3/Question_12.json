{"question": "Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive?", "answer": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To begin solving this problem, let's first determine the total number of outcomes possible when rolling two six-sided dice.\n\nEach dice has 6 possible outcomes (numbers 1 through 6), so the total number of outcomes for rolling two dice is 6 multiplied by 6, which equals 36.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive.\n\nTo do this, we can create a table showing the possible outcomes for each roll:\n\nDice 1:    1   2   3   4   5   6\nDice 2:\n__________________________________\n1             2   3   4   5   6   7\n2                3   4   5   6   7   8\n3                   4   5   6   7   8   9\n4                      5   6   7   8   9  10\n5                         6   7   8   9  10  11\n6                            7   8   9  10  11  12\n\nCounting the number of outcomes in the table, we find that there are 36 outcomes in total, which aligns with the number of possible outcomes we calculated earlier.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers is between 3 and 11, inclusive.
