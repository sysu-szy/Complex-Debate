For a number to be divisible by $n$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $n$. \n\nWe are told that the last digit of the two-digit number is $n$, so the sum of the digits of the number is $n + n = 2n$. Thus, for the number to be divisible by $n$, we need $2n$ to be divisible by $n$.\n\nAt this point, we can begin testing values for $n$. \n\nIf $n=1$, then $2n = 2$, which is not divisible by 1.

In other words, we want to find a number where the last digit is a divisor of the entire number.\n\nTo start, let's write the two-digit integer as $10a+n$, where $a$ denotes the tens digit and $n$ denotes the ones digit. We know that this number is divisible by its last digit, so we can set up the equation $10a + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. Simplifying this equation, we have $10a \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. \n\nTo find the possible values of $n$ that satisfy this equation, we need to consider the divisors of $10a$. Since $10a$ is always divisible by $1$ and $10a$ itself, we can ignore those divisors. Therefore, we want to find the largest proper divisor of $10a$ that is less than $10a$.\n\nIf $a$ is odd, then $10a$ is also odd, and the largest proper divisor of an odd number is always one less than the number itself. So in this case, the largest proper divisor of $10a$ that is less than $10a$ is $10a-1$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then $10a$ is even. The largest proper divisor of an even number is always at most half of the number itself, so the largest proper divisor of $10a$ that is less than $10a$ is $\\dfrac{10a}{2} = 5a$.\n\nNow, we want to find the greatest possible value of $n$, which is the last digit of our two-digit integer. Since $n$ is a divisor of $10a$, it must be either $10a-1$ or $5a$. We want to find the larger value between these two options.\n\nTo determine which one is larger, we can compare the expressions: $10a-1$ and $5a$. Subtracting $5a$ from both sides of the equation, we have $10a - 5a -1 > 0$. Simplifying this inequality, we get $5a-1 > 0$. Adding $1$ to both sides gives $5a > 1$, and dividing by $5$, we have $a > \\dfrac{1}{5}$. Since $a$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $a$ in this case is $1$, which gives us $n = 10(1)-1 = 9$.\n\nThus, the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.", "round 1": "Let's reexamine the problem and the solutions provided. \n\nWe are given a two-digit integer that is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$.

We set up the equation $10a + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ and simplified it to $10a \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. We then considered the divisors of $10a$ to find the largest proper divisor of $10a$ that is less than $10a$. \n\nUsing this approach, I found that the largest possible value of $n$ is 9. However, upon reviewing other solutions, I realized I made a mistake. \n\nIn Agent solution0 and Agent solution2, it was mentioned that for a two-digit integer to be divisible by $n$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $n$.

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's assume the two-digit integer is written as $\\underline{ab}$, where $a$ represents the tens digit and $b$ represents the units digit. The value of the two-digit integer can be expressed as $10a+b$, since the tens digit is always multiplied by 10.\n\nNow, we are given that the two-digit integer is divisible by $n$, which means that $10a+b$ is divisible by $n$. This implies that both $10a$ and $b$ are divisible by $n$.\n\nLet's break down the possible values of $n$ to find the greatest one:\n\n1. $n=1$: If $n=1$, then any number can be divided by $n=1$. However, this contradicts the condition that the last digit is $n$, since no two-digit number ends in 1. Therefore, $n=1$ is not a valid solution.\n\n2. $n=2$: For $n=2$, both $10a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 2. Observing the last digit, $b$, we find that $b$ must be an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) to be divisible by 2. However, we also need to make sure that $a$ is an even number to ensure that $10a$ is divisible by 2. This means the units digit, $b$, can be any even number from 0 to 8, and the tens digit, $a$, can be any even number from 0 to 9. Thus, $n=2$ is a valid solution.\n\n3. $n=3$: For $n=3$, both $10a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3. Considering the last digit, $b$, we find that $b$ must be 0, 3, 6, or 9 to be divisible by 3. For the tens digit, we need to determine whether any combination of $a$ and $b$ will produce a multiple of 3. Looking at the possible values of $a$ and $b$, we find that $10a+b$ is divisible by 3 if either $a=0$ or $a=3$. Therefore, $n=3$ is a valid solution.\n\n4. $n=4$: For $n=4$, both $10a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 4. Considering the last digit, $b$, we find that $b$ can be 0, 4, or 8 to be divisible by 4. For the tens digit, we need to determine whether any combination of $a$ and $b$ will produce a multiple of 4. We observe that $10a+b$ is divisible by 4 if either $a=0$ or $a=2$. Therefore, $n=4$ is a valid solution.\n\n5. $n=5$: For $n=5$, the two-digit integer must end in 5. However, we are also required to have the tens digit be divisible by 5, which means $a$ must be 0, 5, or 10. Since the integer cannot be greater than 99, we find that the greatest possible value for $a$ is 10. Therefore, $n=5$ is not a valid solution.\n\n6. $n=6$: For $n=6$, both $10a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 6. Considering the last digit, $b$, we find that $b$ must be an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) to be divisible by 2, and it must also be divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, or 9) to be divisible by 3. This means that $b$ must be 0 or 6 to satisfy both conditions. For the tens digit, we need to determine whether any combination of $a$ and $b$ will produce a multiple of 6. We observe that $10a+b$ is divisible by 6 if either $a=0$ or $a=6$. Therefore, $n=6$ is a valid solution.\n\nFrom our analysis, we find that the possible values of $n$ are $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$, with the greatest possible value being $n=\\boxed{4}$.\n\nNote: A two-digit integer ending in 0 would not satisfy the condition that its last digit is $n$.
