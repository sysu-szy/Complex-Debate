Since $28=2^2\\cdot 7$, the prime factorization of $28n$ can be written as $2^2\\cdot 7\\cdot n$.\n\nIn order for $28n$ to be divisible by $365$, it must have the same prime factors as $365$, and their exponents must be greater than or equal to the ones in the prime factorization of $365$.\n\nFrom the prime factorization of $365$, we see that the exponent of $5$ is $1$ (since $365=5^1\\cdot73^1$). Therefore, the exponent of $5$ in the prime factorization of $28n$ must also be at least $1$.\n\nHowever, the prime factorization of $28n$ contains no factors of $5$, so we need to multiply $28n$ by a multiple of $5$ in order to achieve the desired exponent of $5$.\n\nOne way to proceed is to find the smallest multiple of $7$ that has a units digit of $5$.

Comparing this to the prime factorization of $365$, we see that all the exponents of the prime factors are greater than or equal to the ones in the prime factorization of $365$.\n\nHence, the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$ is $n=\\boxed{35}$.", "round 1": "To find the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$, we can consider the prime factorizations of $365$ and $28$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $365$ is $365 = 5 \\cdot 73$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $28$ is $28 = 2^2 \\cdot 7$.\n\nTo find the least common multiple (LCM) of $365$ and $28$, we need to consider the highest powers of each prime factor.
