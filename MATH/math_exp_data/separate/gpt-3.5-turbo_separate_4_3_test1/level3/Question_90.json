While it is true that $AC$ is a chord of the circle, it is not necessarily the diameter.\n\nTo find the radius of the circle, we can use another property of a circle, which is that perpendicular bisectors of chords intersect at the center of the circle.\n\nSince $AB$ and $BC$ are both chords of the circle, we can construct the perpendicular bisectors of these chords and find their intersection point.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of $AB$ will intersect $AC$ at point $M$, which is the midpoint of $AC$.
