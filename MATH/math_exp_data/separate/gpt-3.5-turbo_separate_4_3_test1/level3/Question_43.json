{"question": "Alistair Inc. shipped 32 packs of batteries to a retail store. Regular packs contain four batteries each, and super packs contain six batteries. A total of 166 batteries were shipped. How many regular packs were sent?", "answer": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$.
