{"question": "A movie theater seats $100$ patrons. The theater is full for the 5:00 pm Saturday movie. Adult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each and children's tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each. If the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show, how many children's tickets were sold?", "answer": "We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's assume that the number of adult tickets sold is $x$ and the number of children's tickets sold is $y$.\n\nWe know that the theater seats $100$ patrons, so the total number of tickets sold must be equal to $100$:\n\\[x + y = 100\\]\n\nWe also know that the total ticket sales amount to $\\$640$. The cost of an adult ticket is $\\$9.00$, and the cost of a child's ticket is $\\$5.00$. So, we can also write the equation:\n\\[9x + 5y = 640\\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using algebraic methods.\n\nTo eliminate one variable, let's multiply the first equation by $5$ and the second equation by $-1$, and then add the two equations together:\n\\[(5x + 5y) + (-9x - 5y) = (100)(5) + (640)(-1)\\]\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\\[-4x = -460\\]\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $-4$ yields:\n\\[x = 115\\]\n\nSince $x$ represents the number of adult tickets sold, it cannot be $115$ as there are only $100$ seats available. So, there must be an error in our calculations.\n\nLet's go back and double-check our steps.\n\nOur original system of equations is:\n\\[x + y = 100\\]\n\\[9x + 5y = 640\\]\n\nTo eliminate one variable, we will multiply the first equation by $9$ and the second equation by $-1$ and then add the two equations together:\n\\[9x + 9y + (-9x - 5y) = (100)(9) + (640)(-1)\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[4y = -260\\]\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $4$ yields:\n\\[y = -65\\]\n\nWait a minute! How can we have a negative value for the number of children's tickets sold? It seems that we made a mistake in our calculations again.\n\nLet's reexamine the problem and equations.\n\nThe problem states that the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show. We want to find the number of children's tickets sold, which we'll denote as $y$. However, we made an error in assuming that $y$ represents the number of children's tickets sold. Instead, the problem states that the theater is full for the show, so $100$ patrons attended.\n\nLet's correct our equations accordingly:\n\\[x + y = 100\\]\n\\[9x + 5y = 640\\]\n\nNow, we can proceed to solve the updated system of equations. Following the same elimination process:\n\n\\[5x + 5y +9x + 5y = (100)(5) + (640)(9)\\]\n\\[14x + 10y = 500 + 5760\\]\n\\[14x + 10y = 6260\\]\n\nDividing both sides of this equation by $2$ gives:\n\\[7x + 5y = 3130\\]\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by $5$ and subtract it from the second equation:\n\\[(7x + 5y) - (5x + 5y) = 3130 - (100)(5)\\]\n\\[2x = 3080\\]\n\nDividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields:\n\\[x = 1540\\]\n\nAgain, this value of $x$ is not possible since it exceeds the number of available seats. We have made another mistake.\n\nLet's reexamine the problem and equations once more.\n\nThe problem states that the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show.
