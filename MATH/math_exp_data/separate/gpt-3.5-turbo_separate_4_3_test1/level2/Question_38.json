To do that, we'll set it equal to a perfect square, say n^2.\n\n4x + 12 = n^2\n\nNow, let's work with this equation and find a value for x.\n\nStep 4: Choose the smallest possible value for n\nSince we're looking for the least possible sum, we want n to be as small as possible.

This means that the left side of the equation is always divisible by 4.\n\nSecond, observe that if we take any perfect square and divide it by 4, the remainder can only be 0 or 1, but never 2 or 3.

We know that the difference of two squares is always even. Since n^2 is always odd (as the square of an even number is always even), n^2 - 3 must be odd. This means that 2x must be odd, which implies that x is also odd.\n\nLet's represent x as 2m + 1, where m is a non-negative integer.\nx = 2m + 1\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n2x = (2m + 1)^2 - 3\n2x = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - 3\n2x = 4m^2 + 4m - 2\nx = 2m^2 + 2m - 1\n\nTherefore, the expression for the sum of the four consecutive positive even integers is:\n8x + 12 = 8(2m^2 + 2m - 1) + 12\n8x + 12 = 16m^2 + 16m - 4 + 12\n8x + 12 = 16m^2 + 16m + 8\n8x + 12 = 8(2m^2 + 2m + 1)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n8x + 12 = 8(2m^2 + 2m + 1)\n8x + 12 = 8(2m + 1)^2\n\nSince we want to find the least possible sum, we want to minimize the value of (2m + 1)^2. The smallest possible value for (2m + 1) is 1, which gives us a sum of:\n8(1)^2 + 12 = 8 + 12 = 20\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of the four consecutive positive even integers is \\boxed{20}.", "round 2": "Upon reviewing the solutions provided by other agents and reassessing the problem, I can see that my original solution contained a mistake. I assumed that the first even integer, x, was positive, which led to an incorrect value for the smallest possible sum. \n\nLet's rework the solution step by step, taking into account the valid points raised by other agents:\n\nWe are given that the sum of four consecutive positive even integers is a perfect square. Let's represent the first even integer as -x, where x is a positive integer. The four consecutive even integers would then be -x, -x + 2, -x + 4, and -x + 6.\n\nThe sum of these four integers is:\n(-x) + (-x + 2) + (-x + 4) + (-x + 6) = -4x + 12.\n\nWe are told that this sum is a perfect square. Let's represent it as k^2, where k is a positive integer:\n-4x + 12 = k^2.\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to isolate x:\n-4x = k^2 - 12.\n\nThe right side of the equation must be even (as the sum of consecutive even numbers is always even), so let's represent k as 2m, where m is a positive integer:\n-4x = (2m)^2 - 12.\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n-4x = 4m^2 - 12,\nx = 3 - m^2.\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible sum, so we need to minimize the value of x. Since x is positive, let's consider the smallest value for m, which is 1:\nx = 3 - 1^2 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum using this value of x:\n-4(2) + 12 = -8 + 12 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of the four consecutive positive even integers is \\boxed{4}."}]}
