We can find four perfect cubes in the list, namely $3^3,\\ldots,6^3$.

We know that $2^3 = 8$ and $3^3 = 27$, so the smallest perfect cube greater than or equal to $25$ is $3^3 = 27$. Similarly, we need to find the largest perfect cube that is less than or equal to $250$. We know that $5^3 = 125$ and $6^3 = 216$, so the largest perfect cube less than or equal to $250$ is $6^3 = 216$. \n\nTherefore, the list of integers that are perfect cubes is $27,$ $64,$ $125,$ $216$. \nNow we need to determine how many numbers are in this list. The difference between consecutive perfect cubes is at least $35$, so we can find the number of integers in the list by dividing the difference between the smallest and largest perfect cubes by $35$ and adding $1$.\n\nThe difference between $27$ and $216$ is $216 - 27 = 189$. Dividing $189$ by $35$ gives us a quotient of $5$ with a remainder of $4$. Since the remainder is not $0$, we know that there are actually $5 + 1 = 6$ integers in the list $27,$ $64,$ $125,$ $216$.\n\nNow we need to find the total number of integers from $25$ to $250$. The difference between $25$ and $250$ is $250 - 25 = 225$. Dividing $225$ by $1$ we see that there are $225$ integers in the list $25,$ $26,$ $27,$ $\\dots,$ $250$.\n\nTo find the number of integers that are not perfect cubes, we need to subtract the number of integers in the list of perfect cubes from the total number of integers in the list.
