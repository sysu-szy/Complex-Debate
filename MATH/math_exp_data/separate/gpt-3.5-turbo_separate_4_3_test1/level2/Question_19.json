In this case, the constant term is $-24$. We need to find two integers $A$ and $B$ such that $A \\cdot B = -24$. \n\nWe can start by listing all the pairs of integers whose product is -24: $(-1, 24)$, $(1, -24)$, $(-2, 12)$, $(2, -12)$, $(-3, 8)$, $(3, -8)$, $(-4, 6)$, $(4, -6)$, $(-6, 4)$, $(6, -4)$, $(-8, 3)$, $(8, -3)$, $(-12, 2)$, $(12, -2)$, $(-24, 1)$, and $(24, -1)$.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these pairs can also be combined to give us the coefficient of $x$ in the quadratic expression, which is $-1$. To do this, we can look for pairs whose sum or difference is equal to $-1$. \n\nFrom the list above, we see that the pair $(-4, 6)$ satisfies this condition since $-4 + 6 = 2$ and $2 \\cdot -4 = -8$. \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as $(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)$ where $A = -4$ and $B = 6$.
