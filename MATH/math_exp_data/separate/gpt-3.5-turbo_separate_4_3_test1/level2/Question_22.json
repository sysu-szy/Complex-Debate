We'll also draw two circles inside the rectangle to represent MATHCOUNTS and the science club.\n\nNow, we know that 28 students participate in MATHCOUNTS, so we'll write 28 inside the circle representing MATHCOUNTS. Similarly, 21 students participate in the science club, so we'll write 21 inside the circle representing the science club.\n\nNext, we are told that 6 students participate in neither MATHCOUNTS nor the science club. Since the total number of students in the class is 50, we can subtract the number of students who participate in either MATHCOUNTS or the science club from the total number of students to find the number of students who participate in neither.\n\nIf we add the number of students who participate in MATHCOUNTS and the number of students who participate in the science club (28 + 21), we get 49. However, we have counted the students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club twice in this sum.\n\nTo find the number of students who participate in both, we need to subtract the number of students who participate in both from our sum of 49.\n\nLet's say the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and the science club is x.
