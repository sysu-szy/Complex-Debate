When a number is divisible by 11, the difference between the sums of its odd-placed digits and the sum of its even-placed digits is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, let's consider the number 32633:\n- The odd-placed digits are 3, 6, and 3, and their sum is 3 + 6 + 3 = 12.\n- The even-placed digits are 2 and 3, and their sum is 2 + 3 = 5.\n- The difference between the sums is 12 - 5 = 7, which is not 0 or a multiple of 11.

Since 1000 is not divisible by 11, we need to find the largest multiple of 11 that is less than 1000.\n\nWe start by considering the largest possible sum of odd-placed digits, which is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 (when all three digits are 9). The largest possible sum of even-placed digits is 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 (when all four digits are 9).\n\nNext, we find the difference between these sums: 36 - 27 = 9.
