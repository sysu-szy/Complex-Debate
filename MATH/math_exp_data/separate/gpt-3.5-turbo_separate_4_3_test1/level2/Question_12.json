The numerator, 100,000,000, is a positive number. Since we are trying to find the smallest positive integer solution, we can focus on the smallest possible value for the denominator $x$. \n\nThe smallest possible value for $x$ is 1. Therefore, $\\frac{100,000,000}{1^4} = 100,000,000$. Since $100,000,000$ is greater than $1$, this solution does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nWe now need to check if there are any smaller values for $x$ that might satisfy the inequality. Since the denominator is a positive number ($x^4$), the larger the value of $x$, the smaller the resulting fraction. Thus, we are looking for the largest possible value for $x$ that will make $\\frac{100,000,000}{x^4}$ less than $1$.\n\nWe can start by trying $x=2$.

Since $6,250,000$ is greater than $1$, this solution does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nLet's continue to increase $x$ and evaluate the expression $\\frac{100,000,000}{x^4}$:\n\nFor $x=3$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{3^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{81} = 1,234,568.3$, which is still greater than $1$.\n\nFor $x=4$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{4^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{256} = 390,625$, which is still greater than $1$.\n\nFor $x=5$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{5^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{625} = 160,000$, which is still greater than $1$.\n\nFor $x=6$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{6^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{1,296} = 77,160.49$, which is still greater than $1$.\n\nFor $x=7$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{7^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{2,401} = 41,485.64$, which is still greater than $1$.\n\nFinally, for $x=8$, we have $\\frac{100,000,000}{8^4} = \\frac{100,000,000}{4,096} = 24,414.06$, which is less than $1$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive integer solution, we can conclude that $x=8$ is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality $(100,000,000 \\div x^4)<1$ is $\\boxed{8}$.", "round 1": "To solve the inequality $(100,000,000 \\div x^4) < 1$, we need to find the smallest positive integer solution for $x$.
