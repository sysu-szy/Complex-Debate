{"question": "At a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?", "answer": "From ``$3$'' to ``$9$'' is a difference of 6 hours out of the 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$ of the degrees on the clock. From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock. Since the clock has $360^\\circ$, the angle decreases by $\\frac{360}{6}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the angle between the hands when they are on the \"$3$'' and \"$9$'' positions. \n\nIn the \"$3$'' position, the minute hand points directly to the right, which is equivalent to an angle of $0$ degrees. The hour hand, in the \"$9$'' position, points directly down, which is equivalent to an angle of $270$ degrees.\n\nThe angle between the hands is the difference between the angles at which they are pointing. In this case, it is $270^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 270^\\circ.$\n\nNow, let's consider the position where the hands are on the \"$2$'' and \"$10$''. \n\nIn the \"$2$'' position, the minute hand points to the right but slightly upwards. To find the angle it makes, we need to determine what fraction of an hour (or $360$ degrees) has passed.

Similarly, we need to find the fraction of an hour it covers. Since the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12 \\times 60} = 0.5^\\circ$ per minute, the fraction of an hour moved is $\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nCombining the fractions of an hour, the minute hand has moved $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$ of an hour, which is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 360^\\circ = 120^\\circ.$ The hour hand, moving at a rate of $\\frac{0.5^\\circ}{\\text{minute}}$, has moved $\\frac{10}{60} \\times 0.5^\\circ = \\frac{5}{6}^\\circ.$\n\nThe angle between the hands is the difference between the angles at which they are pointing.
