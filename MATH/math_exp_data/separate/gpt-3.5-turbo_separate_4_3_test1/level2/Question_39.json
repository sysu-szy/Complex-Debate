Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily first mentally figures the value of $40^2$ and then adds $164$. Let's determine the value of $40^2$ and find out why Emily adds $164$.\n\nWe know that any number squared is equal to the number multiplied by itself. So, $40^2$ is equal to $40\\times40$. To find this value, we can multiply the tens digits and then add the product of the units digits. Let's calculate it step by step:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\times\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\nFirst, we multiply $0$ in the units place with $40$ in the tens place:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\times\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\phantom{0}00\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNext, we multiply $4$ in the units place with $40$ in the tens place:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\times\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\phantom{0}00 \\\\\n+160\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWe add these two partial products:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\times\\phantom{0}40 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\phantom{0}00 \\\\\n+\\phantom{0}160 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\phantom{0}160\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThus, $40^2$ is equal to $1600$. \n\nNow, let's examine why Emily adds $164$ to the result. We can express $42^2$ as the sum of $(40^2 + 164)$. To understand why we add $164$, let's compare the difference between the squares of consecutive numbers, especially when the numbers are even.\n\nThe difference between the squares of consecutive even numbers is equal to the sum of those two consecutive numbers. For example, the difference between $4^2$ and $2^2$ is $4+2=6$. Similarly, the difference between $6^2$ and $4^2$ is $6+4=10$. This pattern continues.\n\nFor the problem at hand, we can observe that the difference between $42^2$ and $40^2$ is $42+40=82$. Therefore, Emily adds $82$ to $40^2$ to calculate $42^2$.\n\nHowever, this leads us to a discrepancy. We stated earlier that Emily added $164$ to $40^2$, but now we found that the correct value to add is actually $82$. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in the given problem statement or a mistake in the solution. Without further clarification, we cannot determine an accurate answer for the number Emily subtracts from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$. \n\nThus, we cannot provide a definite answer at this time.", "round 1": "To calculate $42^2$, Emily first mentally figures the value of $40^2$ and adds $164$. However, we have determined in our previous analysis that the correct value to add is actually $82$, not $164$. Therefore, let's recalculate using the correct value.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $40^2$.\nSince $40$ is a multiple of $10$, we can use a shortcut to calculate its square. We know that $(10a)^2 = 100a^2$.
