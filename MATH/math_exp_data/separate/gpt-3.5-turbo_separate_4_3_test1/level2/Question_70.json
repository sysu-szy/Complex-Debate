Finally, we can calculate the positive difference between the volumes.\n\nLet's assume the edge length of the first cube is \"x\" centimeters. We are given that the volume of the first cube is 343 cubic centimeters. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = x^3, where V represents the volume. So, we can write the equation V = x^3 = 343.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to take the cube root of 343. The cube root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times (cubed), gives the original number. In this case, the cube root of 343 is 7, because 7 * 7 * 7 = 343.\n\nNow we know that the edge length of the first cube is 7 centimeters. \n\nAccording to the problem, the edge length of the second cube is three times the edge length of the first cube, which means it is equal to 3 * 7 = 21 centimeters.\n\nTo find the volume of the second cube, we can use the formula V = x^3 again, where x is the edge length of the second cube. So, the volume of the second cube is V = 21^3 = 9261 cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, we can calculate the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube.
