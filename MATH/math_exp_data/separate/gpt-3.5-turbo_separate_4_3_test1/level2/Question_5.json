We will label them as A1 and A2 for convenience.\n\nFor the letter M, there are two ways it can be arranged since there are two M's in the word. We will label them as M1 and M2 for convenience.\n\nFor the letter S, there is only one way it can be arranged since it is the only S in the word.\n\nSo far, we have the following: G, A1, A2, M1, M2, S.\n\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply together the number of ways each letter can be arranged.
