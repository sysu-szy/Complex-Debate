From the given information, the units digit of $X$ can be 2, 5, 8, or 1, and the units digit of $(5n + 4)$ can be 4, 9, 2, or 7.\n\nConsidering the possible overlapping units digits, we find that 2 and 7 are the only options. This means that $X$ can have a units digit of 2 or 7.\n\nStep 4: Expressing $X$ in the form $10k + b$. If $X$ has a units digit of 2, we can express it as $X = 10k + 2$. If $X$ has a units digit of 7, we can express it as $X = 10k + 7$, where $k$ represents the tens digit and $b$ represents the units digit.\n\nStep 5: Determining the smallest possible value of $X$.\n\nCase 1: If $X$ has a units digit of 2, we substitute $X = 10k + 2$ into the equation $X = 3m + 2$:\n\n$10k + 2 = 3m + 2$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n$10k = 3m$\n\nSince 10 and 3 are relatively prime, there are no positive integers $k$ and $m$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nCase 2: If $X$ has a units digit of 7, we substitute $X = 10k + 7$ into the equation $X = 3m + 2$:\n\n$10k + 7 = 3m + 2$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n$10k + 5 = 3m$\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of $k$ that satisfies this equation.\nLet's substitute $k$ with different values and check the corresponding remainder when divided by 3:\n\nFor $k = 1$: $10(1) + 5 = 15$ gives a remainder of 0 when divided by 3.\nFor $k = 2$: $10(2) + 5 = 25$ gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\nFor $k = 3$: $10(3) + 5 = 35$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.\n\nHence, the smallest possible value for $k$ is 3, which gives us $X = 10(3) + 7 = \\boxed{37}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is $\\boxed{37}$."}]}
