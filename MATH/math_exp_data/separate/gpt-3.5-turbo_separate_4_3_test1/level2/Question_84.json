Since $E\\ne G$, it must be that $E+1=G$ in order to get $G$ in the hundreds place. Since a $1$ is carried over, we have $G+G=10+M$. Now we look at the units place. Either $M+M=M$ or $M+M=10+M$. In the second case, $2M=10+M\\qquad\\Rightarrow M=10$, which is not a possible digit. So it must be that $2M=M$, which is only possible if $M=0$. Now $2G=10\\qquad\\Rightarrow G=5$ and $E+1=G\\qquad\\Rightarrow E=4$. The numerical value of $E$ is $\\boxed{4}$. We can check that $450+50=500$, which matches the digits in the addition problem.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To find the numerical value of E, we need to solve the addition problem systematically.\n\nFirst, let's look at the units digit column, where we add G + M + M. The sum of three distinct digits cannot be greater than 27 (9 + 9 + 9), so we can determine that G + M + M = G + 2M. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is just the units digit of G + 2M.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens digit column, where we add G + M. Since the sum of two distinct digits cannot be greater than 18 (9 + 9), we know that G + M < 10. Therefore, the tens digit of the sum is just G + M.\n\nNow let's look at the hundreds digit column, where we add E + G + M. Since E, G, and M are three distinct digits, their sum cannot be greater than 27 (9 + 9 + 9). Therefore, the hundreds digit of the sum is just E.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that E is the hundreds digit of the sum.\n\nNow let's consider how the units digit of the sum, G + 2M, relates to the tens digit of the sum, G + M. If G + 2M is less than 10, then the tens digit will be the same as the units digit. However, if G + 2M is greater than or equal to 10, then the tens digit will be one more than the units digit.\n\nIf G + 2M < 10, then the problem becomes G + M + G + M = 2G + 2M = 20 + G. In this case, E = G since the hundreds digit of the sum is the same as the hundreds digit of 20 + G.\n\nIf G + 2M \u2265 10, then the problem becomes G + M + G + M - 10 = 2G + 2M - 10 = 20 + G - 10 = 10 + G. In this case, E = 1 + G since the hundreds digit of the sum is one more than the hundreds digit of 10 + G.\n\nTherefore, the numerical value of E can be either G or 1 + G, depending on whether G + 2M is less than 10 or greater than or equal to 10, respectively.\n\nIn order to determine the value of E, we need more information about the values of G and M.\n\nHence, the answer is \\boxed{{cannot be determined without more information}}.", "round 1": "Based on the reasoning from other agents, we can deduce that:\n\n- Case 1: If M = 0, then G + G = 0, which implies that G must also be 0.

Therefore, E + G + G = G.\n\nNext, considering the units place, since G + M + M = M, and G does not carry over, it follows that E + M + M = M.\n\nNow, let's analyze the tens place.
