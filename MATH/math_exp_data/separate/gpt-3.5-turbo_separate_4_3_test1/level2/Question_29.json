We can write this as an equation:\n\n7 ligs = 4 lags\n\nNext, we are given that 9 lags is equal to 20 lugs. We can write this as another equation:\n\n9 lags = 20 lugs\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ligs that are equivalent to 80 lugs. Let's start by finding how many lugs are equivalent to 1 lag. To do this, we will divide both sides of the second equation by 9:\n\n(9 lags) / 9 = (20 lugs) / 9\n\n1 lag = 20/9 lugs\n\nNow, we can use this information to find how many lugs are equivalent to 7 ligs.
