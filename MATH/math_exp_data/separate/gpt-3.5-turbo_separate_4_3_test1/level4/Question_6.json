When we multiply two-digit numbers, the maximum possible product is $81$ ($9 \\times 9$), which is only two digits long. Therefore, the $1_b$ in the units digit can only be obtained from performing $b \\times b$ if $b = 1$ or $b = 0$. However, in this problem, it is stated that $P$ and $b$ represent two distinct digits. Therefore, we conclude that $b$ cannot be $0$ or $1$.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens digit column. We need to compute $(10P + b) \\times Pb$. The maximum possible product when multiplying two three-digit numbers is $999 \\times 999 = 998,001$, which is six digits long. Since the product in this problem is $31_b$, it must be less than $1000$ and therefore its tens digit must be $0$. \n\nNow, we can set up the multiplication $(10P + b) \\times Pb$:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n& & 1 & P_b & \\\\\n& \\times & & P_b & \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n+ & & & & & (0) \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n\\end{array}$$\n\nSince the tens digit in the product is $0$, we know that $(10P + b) \\times Pb$ does not have any tens digit contribution. Therefore, we can ignore the tens digit multiplication and focus only on the units digit multiplication: $b \\times Pb = 31_b$. \n\nWe need to find values for $b$ and $P$ that satisfy this equation. $b$ is a digit from $2$ to $9$ (since we already concluded $b \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 1$). Let's try each possibility one by one:\n\nFor $b = 2$, we have $2 \\times Pb = 31_2$. However, when multiplying $2$ by any other digit, we obtain an even number as the product, so this option does not work.\n\nFor $b = 3$, we have $3 \\times Pb = 31_3$. To find $P$, we need to divide $31_3$ by $3$. Performing the division, we find that $P$ is equal to $10_3$. However, since $P$ and $b$ represent distinct digits, $P$ cannot be equal to $b$. Therefore, this option does not work.\n\nWe continue trying all possible values of $b$:\n\nFor $b = 4$, $4 \\times Pb = 31_4$. However, when we multiply $4$ by any other digit, the product exceeds $31_4$. So, this option does not work.\n\nFor $b = 5$, $5 \\times Pb = 31_5$. However, the product of $5$ by any other digit, when written in base $5$, has a units digit of $0$ since $5 \\times b = 10_b$. So, this option does not work.\n\nFor $b = 6$, $6 \\times Pb = 31_6$. However, the product of $6$ by any other digit, when written in base $6$, has a units digit of $0$ since $6 \\times b = 10_b$. So, this option does not work.\n\nFor $b = 7$, $7 \\times Pb = 31_7$. However, the largest possible digit in base $7$ is $6$, so there is no value for $P$ that satisfies this equation. So, this option does not work.\n\nFor $b = 8$, $8 \\times Pb = 31_8$. However, the largest possible digit in base $8$ is $7$, so there is no value for $P$ that satisfies this equation. So, this option does not work.\n\nFinally, for $b = 9$, $9 \\times Pb = 31_9$. To find $P$, we divide $31_9$ by $9$. The quotient is $3$ with a remainder of $4$, which means $P = 3_9$. \n\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is $b = 9$ and $P = 3$.
