We are given that one Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. \n\nFrom this information, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets         (equation 1)\n3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets      (equation 2)\n\nTo find the relationship between Trinkets and Drinkets, we need to eliminate Blinkets from the equations. For that, we can multiply equation 1 by 3, which gives us:\n\n3 Trinkets = 12 Blinkets       (equation 3)\n\nNow, let's combine equations 2 and 3. Since they both have the term \"Blinkets,\" we can equate them:\n\n12 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets\n\nTo find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we can now set up a proportion. Let's use x to represent the value in Trinkets:\n\n12 Blinkets / 7 Drinkets = x Trinkets / 56 Drinkets\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n12 Blinkets * 56 Drinkets = 7 Drinkets * x Trinkets\n672 Blinkets = 7x Trinkets\n\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n672 Blinkets / 7 = x Trinkets\n96 Blinkets = x Trinkets\n\nFinally, we can convert Blinkets to Trinkets by applying the relationship given in equation 1. We know that 4 Blinkets equal 1 Trinket, so:\n\n96 Blinkets = x Trinkets / 4\n24 Trinkets = x Trinkets\n\nTherefore, the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets is \\boxed{24}.", "round 1": "To solve this problem, we can follow a similar approach as before. \n\nWe are given that one Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. \n\nLet's start by converting Drinkets to Blinkets.
