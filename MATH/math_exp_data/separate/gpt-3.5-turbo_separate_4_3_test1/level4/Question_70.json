A parabola is a U-shaped curve that is symmetric about a line called the axis of symmetry. The vertex (V) of the parabola is the point where the curve intersects the axis of symmetry. The focus (F) of the parabola is a fixed point located on the axis of symmetry.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at the problem statement. It tells us that a segment through the focus F of the parabola is perpendicular to the line segment FV. This means that the line segment through F and the vertex V is perpendicular to the tangent line at V.\n\nTo find the angle AVB, we can use the fact that a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the center of a circle to the point of tangency. In this case, the parabola has reflective symmetry, so we can consider the line segment AVB as a tangent line to a circle with center at the focus F.\n\nLet's denote the midpoint of the segment AB as M. Since AVB is a right angle, the line segment MV is the radius of the circle. By the properties of a tangent line, the radius of the circle and the tangent line are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSince the segment through F and V is perpendicular to the tangent line, we can conclude that the line segment FM is also perpendicular to AVB. Therefore, the angle FMV is a right angle. This means that the angle AVB is the complement of the angle FMV.\n\nLet's denote the coordinates of point F as (a, b) and the coordinates of the point V as (h, k). Since the vertex V is the midpoint of segment AB, we can write the coordinates of point M as ((h + a)/2, (k + b)/2).\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope of the line segment FM. The slope of FM is given by:\n\nslope(FM) = (k + b)/2 - b / (h + a)/2 - a\n           = (k + b - 2b) / (h + a - 2a)\n           = (k - b) / (h - a)\n\nSince FM is perpendicular to AVB, the product of their slopes is equal to -1.

The cosine of an angle can be calculated as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
