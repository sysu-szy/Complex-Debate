We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AC. Let's call the length of AD as x. Then the length of AC becomes \u221a(6^2 + x^2).\n\nNow, let's consider triangle ABX. Since it is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of BX. We have the following relationship: \u221a((6-x)^2 + BX^2) = 10.\n\nNow, we need to find the length of BX. To do this, we can solve the above equation for BX. We square both sides of the equation and simplify:\n\n(6-x)^2 + BX^2 = 100\n36 - 12x + x^2 + BX^2 = 100\nBX^2 + x^2 - 12x - 64 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation in terms of BX. We can try to solve this equation by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. However, in this case, it is not easy to factorize or complete the square. So let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nBX = (-(-12) \u00b1 \u221a((-12)^2 - 4(1)(-64))) / (2(1))\nBX = (12 \u00b1 \u221a(144 + 256)) / 2\nBX = (12 \u00b1 \u221a400) / 2\nBX = (12 \u00b1 20) / 2\n\nNow we have two possible values for BX: BX = (12 + 20) / 2 = 16 and BX = (12 - 20) / 2 = -4. However, since BX is a length, it cannot be negative. Therefore, we discard the negative value (-4) and take BX = 16.\n\nNow, let's find the distance from point X to the midpoint M of diagonal AC. Since M is the midpoint of AC, we know that AM = MC. Therefore, X is equidistant from points A and C. In other words, XM = XC.\n\nWe know that AC = 10, so AM = MC = 10/2 = 5.
