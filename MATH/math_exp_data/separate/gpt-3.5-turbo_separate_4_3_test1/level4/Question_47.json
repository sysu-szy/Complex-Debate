Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different outcomes for flipping 1 coin. When flipping a single coin, there are 2 possible outcomes - either heads or tails. So the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 1 coin is 0, because we can't get at least 2 heads with just one coin.\n\nNow, let's move on to flipping 2 coins. There are 2 possible outcomes for each coin, so when flipping 2 coins, there are 2^2 = 4 possible outcomes:\n- HH (2 heads)\n- HT (1 head, 1 tail)\n- TH (1 head, 1 tail)\n- TT (2 tails)\n\nSo, out of the 4 possible outcomes, there is only 1 outcome where we get at least 2 heads (HH). Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 2 coins is 1/4.\n\nNext, let's consider flipping 3 coins. There are 2 possible outcomes for each coin, so when flipping 3 coins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes:\n- HHH (3 heads)\n- HHT (2 heads, 1 tail)\n- HTH (2 heads, 1 tail)\n- THH (2 heads, 1 tail)\n- HTT (1 head, 2 tails)\n- THT (1 head, 2 tails)\n- TTH (1 head, 2 tails)\n- TTT (3 tails)\n\nOut of the 8 possible outcomes, there are 4 outcomes where we get at least 2 heads (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH). Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 3 coins is 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's consider flipping 4 coins. Again, there are 2 possible outcomes for each coin, so when flipping 4 coins, there are 2^4 = 16 possible outcomes. However, listing all 16 outcomes might be time-consuming, so let's use a methodical approach.\n\nWe can think of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 4 coins as the opposite of getting 0 or 1 head. So let's calculate the probability of getting 0 or 1 head:\n\nWhen flipping 4 coins, getting 0 heads is the outcome TTTT, which has a probability of 1/16. \nWhen flipping 4 coins, getting 1 head can happen in 4 ways: HTTT, THTT, TTHT, TTTH.

So, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 5 coins is 1 - P(0 or 1 head).\n- Getting 0 heads has a probability of 1/32.\n- Getting 1 head has a probability of 5/32.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 5 coins is 1 - (1/32 + 5/32) = 1 - (6/32) = 26/32 = 13/16.\n\nSimilarly, when flipping 6 coins, getting at least 2 heads is the opposite of getting 0 or 1 heads.
