That means:\n$7i + (-7i) = 0$\n$7i \\cdot (-7i) = b$\n\nThe product of $7i$ and $-7i$ is $49i^2$. Since $i^2$ is equal to $-1$, we have:\n$49i^2 = -49$\n\nSo the value of $b$ in this case is $-49$.\nSince the sum of the roots is zero, the coefficients of $x$ must also sum to zero:\n$a = -(7i + (-7i)) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair in this case is $(0, -49)$.\n\nCase 2: The non-real root is $-7i$\nIn this case, we have a quadratic equation with roots $-7i$ and $7i$. Again, using Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$-7i + 7i = 0$\n$-7i \\cdot 7i = b$\n\nFollowing the same logic as in Case 1, we find that the value of $b$ in this case is $-49$.\nSince the sum of the roots is zero, again the coefficients of $x$ must sum to zero:\n$a = -(-7i + 7i) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair in this case is also $(0, -49)$.\n\nIn both cases, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $(0, -49)$.\n\nHence, the solution to the problem is $\\boxed{(0,-49)}$.", "round 1": "Upon re-examining the problem and considering the solutions provided by other agents, I see that the correct answer is indeed $\\boxed{(0,-49)}$.

This is because $7^3 = 343$.\n\nStep 2: Use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots to the coefficients.\nFor a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, Vieta's formulas state that the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{a}$.\n\nIn this case, we have $x^2+ax+b=0$.
