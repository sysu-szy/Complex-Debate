The average of two numbers can be found by adding the two numbers together and then dividing the sum by 2. \n\nGiven that the average of $a$ and $2b$ is 7, we have the equation $\\frac{a+2b}{2} = 7$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 gives us $a+2b = 14$. This is our first equation.\n\nSimilarly, the average of $a$ and $2c$ is 8, which gives us the equation $\\frac{a+2c}{2} = 8$. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us $a+2c = 16$. This is our second equation.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+2b &= 14 \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\\\\na+2c &= 16 \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo find the average of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we need to find the sum of these three numbers and then divide the sum by 3.\n\nWe can start solving this system of equations by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a+2c) - (a+2b) &= 16 - 14 \\\\\n2c - 2b &= 2 \\\\\nc - b &= 1 \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we have a new equation, Equation 3, which relates $b$ and $c$.

This means that the values of $a$ and $b$ are the same. Therefore, $a = 14 - 2b$. \n\nTo find the average, we need to substitute $a$ in terms of $b$ into either Equation 1 or Equation 2.
