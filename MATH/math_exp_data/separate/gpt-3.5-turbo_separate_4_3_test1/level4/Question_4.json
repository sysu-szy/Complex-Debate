Since her SUV averages 15 miles per gallon, we can find the number of gallons used by dividing the total distance (12,000 miles) by the average miles per gallon:\n\nNumber of gallons used by SUV = 12,000 miles / 15 miles per gallon = 800 gallons\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of gallons of gasoline that would be used by the fuel-efficient hybrid car. The hybrid car averages 48 miles per gallon, so we can find the number of gallons used by dividing the total distance (12,000 miles) by the average miles per gallon:\n\nNumber of gallons used by hybrid car = 12,000 miles / 48 miles per gallon = 250 gallons\n\nNow, to find the difference in the number of gallons between the two cars, we subtract the number of gallons used by the SUV from the number of gallons used by the hybrid car:\n\nDifference = Number of gallons used by hybrid car - Number of gallons used by SUV\n= 250 gallons - 800 gallons\n= -550 gallons\n\nSince Karla saved by driving a fuel-efficient hybrid car rather than an SUV, the difference is negative, indicating a saving of 550 gallons of gasoline.\n\nTherefore, Karla would have saved 550 gallons of gasoline last year if she had driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car rather than an SUV.\n\n\\boxed{550 \\text{ gallons}}", "round 1": "After examining the solutions provided by other agents and considering their reasoning, I have reevaluated my approach to solving the problem.
