{"question": "Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, and let \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{a}{b}x & \\text{ if }x\\le-4, \\\\\nabx^2 & \\text{ if }x>-4.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]If $f(-4)=-\\frac{60}{13}$ and $f(4)=3120$, what is $a+b$?", "answer": "Since $-4\\le-4$, we know that $f(-4)=\\frac{a}{b}(-4)=-\\frac{60}{13}$. So, $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{15}{13}$. Next we look at $4>-4$, so $f(4)=ab\\cdot4^2=3120$. That means $ab=\\frac{3120}{16}=195$. Now that we have two equations and two variables, we can solve for $a$ and $b$. From $ab=195$, we get that $a=\\frac{195}{b}$. We substitute this value for $a$ into the equation $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{15}{13}$ to get $\\frac{195}{b^2}=\\frac{15}{13}$.\n\nNext we cross-multiply and get $15b^2=13\\cdot195$. Before multiplying 13 by 195, we try factoring 195 and notice that 15 is a factor of 195, so we can rewrite this as $15b^2=13\\cdot13\\cdot15$. Finally, $b^2=13^2$, so $b=\\pm13$. The problem says that $a$ and $b$ are positive, so $b=13$ and $a=\\frac{195}{13}=15$. The sum $a+b$ equals $\\boxed{28}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To find $a+b$, we need to set up and solve a system of equations using the given information.\n\nFrom the first piecewise function, we know that $f(x) = \\frac{a}{b}x$ if $x\\le-4$. Substituting $x=-4$, we have $$f(-4) = \\frac{a}{b}(-4) = -\\frac{60}{13}.$$Simplifying, we get $-\\frac{4a}{b} = -\\frac{60}{13}$.\n\nFrom the second piecewise function, we know that $f(x) = abx^2$ if $x>-4$. Substituting $x=4$, we have $$f(4) = ab(4)^2 = 3120.$$Simplifying, we get $16ab = 3120$.\n\nNow we have a system of equations.

Dividing both sides by $-4$, we get $13a = 15b$.\n\nSubstituting $13a = 15b$ into $16ab = 3120$, we get $16(13a)(a) = 3120$. Simplifying, we have $208a^2 = 3120$. Dividing both sides by $208$, we get $a^2 = 15$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $a = \\pm\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, we can discard the negative square root.
