This solution satisfies the domain condition $(3x-1) \\geq 0,$ so it is a valid solution in Case 2.\n\nSub-subcase 2.1.2: $9x - 4 < 0$\n\nIn this sub-subcase, we have $|9x - 4| = -(9x - 4) = -9x + 4$. So the equation becomes $-9x + 4 = x$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$. This solution satisfies the domain condition $(3x-1) \\geq 0,$ so it is a valid solution in Case 2.\n\nSubcase 2.2: $3x - 1 < 0$\n\nIn this subcase, $|3x - 1| = -(3x - 1) = -3x + 1$, so $f(f(x)) = f(-3x + 1) = |-3(-3x + 1) - 1| = |-9x + 4|$.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(x)) = x$ can be written as $|-9x + 4| = x$.\n\nWe can again split this equation into two sub-subcases:\n\nSub-subcase 2.2.1: $-9x + 4 \\geq 0$\n\nIn this sub-subcase, we have $|-9x + 4| = -(-9x + 4) = 9x - 4$, so the equation becomes $9x - 4 = x$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This solution satisfies the domain condition $(3x-1) < 0,$ so it is a valid solution in Case 2.\n\nSub-subcase 2.2.2: $-9x + 4 < 0$\n\nIn this sub-subcase, we have $|-9x + 4| = -(9x - 4) = 4 - 9x$. So the equation becomes $4 - 9x = x$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$. This solution satisfies the domain condition $(3x-1) < 0,$ so it is a valid solution in Case 2.\n\nCombining the solutions from both cases, the correct final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}}$."}]}
