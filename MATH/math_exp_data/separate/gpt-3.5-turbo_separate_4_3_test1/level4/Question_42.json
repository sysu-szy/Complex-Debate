With a little work, we see that $49 = 4 + 9 + 36$. Thus, the fewest number of perfect square terms that can be added together to sum to 49 is $\\boxed{3}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, let's start by considering the possible perfect squares that can add up to 49. We know that the perfect squares less than or equal to 49 are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem like we could simply add up six terms consisting of all the perfect squares less than or equal to 49, like in the provided example, such as $25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 0$. However, this is not the optimal solution because it uses more terms than necessary. Our goal is to find the fewest number of perfect square terms needed to sum up to 49.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities more systematically. We can start by trying to use the largest perfect square less than or equal to 49, which is 49 itself. In this case, we would only need one term, and that would be our solution.\n\nHowever, if we consider the second-largest perfect square, which is 36, we would need to find perfect squares whose sum is 49 - 36 = 13. In this case, the largest perfect square less than or equal to 13 is 9. Now, we are left with 13 - 9 = 4. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 4 is 4 itself. Thus, we can find a solution using three terms: 36 + 9 + 4.\n\nContinuing this process, we can consider the next largest perfect square, which is 25. We need to find perfect squares whose sum is 49 - 25 = 24. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 24 is 16. Now, we have 24 - 16 = 8 left. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 8 is again 4. Therefore, we can find another solution using four terms: 25 + 16 + 4 + 4.\n\nLastly, we consider the perfect square 16. We need to find perfect squares that sum up to 49 - 16 = 33. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 33 is 25. After subtracting 25 from 33, we are left with 8. We know that 8 can be represented by using the perfect square 4. Therefore, we can find another solution using four terms: 16 + 25 + 4 + 4.\n\nTo summarize, by systematically considering the largest perfect squares first, we have found three distinct solutions:\n\nSolution 1: 49 (using one term: 49)\nSolution 2: 36 + 9 + 4 (using three terms: 36, 9, 4)\nSolution 3: 25 + 16 + 4 + 4 (using four terms: 25, 16, 4, 4)\n\nAmong these solutions, the fewest number of perfect square terms needed is three.
