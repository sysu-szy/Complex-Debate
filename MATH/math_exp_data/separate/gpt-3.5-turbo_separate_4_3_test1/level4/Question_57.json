{"question": "When Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?", "answer": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.
