The center is the midpoint of the segment joining the two asymptotes. The equation of the first asymptote is $y = 2x - 3,$ and the equation of the second asymptote is $y = 17 - 2x.$\n\nTo find the midpoint, we need to find the sum of the two equations and divide by 2:\n\\[(y + y) = (2x - 3) + (17 - 2x).\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have\n\\[2y = 14,\\]\nwhich gives us $y = 7.$\n\nSubstituting this back into one of the asymptote equations, we find\n\\[7 = 2x - 3,\\]\nwhich leads to $x = 5/2.$ Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is $(5/2, 7).$\n\nNext, we need to find the lengths of the major and minor axes.

The center is the midpoint of the line segment joining the two given asymptotes.\n\nThe equation of a line passing through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be found using the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),$ where $m$ is the slope of the line. To find the slope of a line, we can use the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.$\n\nFor the first asymptote $y = 2x - 3,$ we can take two points on the line as $(0, -3)$ and $(1, -1).$ The slope of the line is then $\\frac{-1 - (-3)}{1 - 0} = 2,$ which matches the coefficient of $x.$\n\nSimilarly, for the second asymptote $y = 17 - 2x,$ we can take two points as $(8, 1)$ and $(9, -7).$ The slope of the line is then $\\frac{-7 - 1}{9 - 8} = -8,$ which matches the coefficient of $x.$\n\nThe midpoint of the line segment joining the points $(0, -3)$ and $(8, 1)$ is given by $\\left(\\frac{0 + 8}{2}, \\frac{-3 + 1}{2}\\right) = (4, -1).$ Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is $(4, -1).$\n\nNext, we need to determine which asymptote is aligned with the transverse axis, i.e., which asymptote is of the form $y = \\pm\\frac{a}{b}x,$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors. This can be done by checking the slope of each asymptote.\n\nFor the first asymptote $y = 2x - 3,$ the ratio of the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ is $\\frac{2}{-1} = -2,$ which is not a fraction of the form $\\pm\\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors.\n\nFor the second asymptote $y = 17 - 2x,$ the ratio of the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ is $\\frac{-2}{1} = -2,$ which is a fraction of the form $\\pm\\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors.\n\nHence, the second asymptote $y = 17 - 2x$ is aligned with the transverse axis. This means that the transverse axis passes through the center of the hyperbola.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the hyperbola. Since the center is $(4, -1),$ and the asymptotes are $y = 17 - 2x$ and $y = -17 + 2x.$ The standard form of a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis is given by the equation\n\\[\\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\\]where $(h,k)$ is the center of the hyperbola, and $2a$ is the distance between the vertices along the transverse axis. Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 4)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]\n\nWe can determine the values of $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that the hyperbola passes through the point $(4, 7).$ Substituting $x = 4$ and $y = 7$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get\n\\[\\frac{(4 - 4)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(7 + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]Expanding and simplifying, we have\n\\[-\\frac{64}{b^2} = 1,\\]so $b^2 = -64.$ Since $b^2$ is negative, this means that the hyperbola is not defined.

A hyperbola is defined as the set of all points in a plane such that the absolute value of the difference of the distances from two fixed points, called the foci, is constant. This constant is typically denoted as 2a. In the standard form, the vertices of the hyperbola are located at (h + a, k) and (h - a, k), where (h, k) is the center of the hyperbola.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information. We are told that the asymptotes of the hyperbola are the lines y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x. Since the slopes of the asymptotes are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs, we can conclude that the hyperbola is centered at the origin. This means that the center of the hyperbola is (0, 0), so h = 0 and k = 0.\n\nNext, we are given that the hyperbola passes through the point (4, 7). Substituting these values into the equation of a hyperbola, we get:\n\nsqrt((4 - h)^2 + (7 - k)^2) - sqrt((4 - (-h))^2 + (7 - (-k))^2) = 2a\n\nSince the center is (h, k) = (0, 0), this simplifies to:\n\nsqrt(4^2 + 7^2) - sqrt((-4)^2 + (-7)^2) = 2a\nsqrt(16 + 49) - sqrt(16 + 49) = 2a\nsqrt(65) - sqrt(65) = 2a\n0 = 2a\n\nFrom this equation, we find that a = 0. This implies that the hyperbola is degenerate and is actually the equation of two intersecting lines.

This means that the coordinates of the foci are at a distance of $c$ from the center, where $c$ is the distance from the center to each vertex of the hyperbola.\n\nLet's denote the center of the hyperbola as $(h, k)$. Since the hyperbola passes through the point $(4, 7)$, we can use this information to find the center.\n\nSubstituting $x=4$ and $y=7$ into the equations of the asymptotes, we get:\n\n$7 = 2(4) - 3 \\Rightarrow 7 = 8 - 3 \\Rightarrow 7 = 5$ -- Contradiction\n$7 = 17 - 2(4) \\Rightarrow 7 = 17 - 8 \\Rightarrow 7 = 9$ -- Contradiction\n\nSince both equations lead to contradictions, the point $(4, 7)$ does not lie on the asymptotes. Hence, the point $(4, 7)$ is the center $(h, k)$ of the hyperbola.\n\nSo, we have $h = 4$ and $k = 7$. Now we can find the vertices of the hyperbola.\n\nLet's label the vertices as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The distance between the vertices is given by $2a$, where $a$ is the distance from the center to the vertices of the hyperbola. The equation of the vertical line that passes through the center is $x = 4$. Substituting $x=4$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get:\n\n$(4-4)^2 - (y-7)^2/a^2 = 1$\n$- (y-7)^2/a^2 = 1$\n\nSince the equation of the hyperbola is of the form $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, we can see that $b^2 = a^2$. Therefore, for a rectangular hyperbola, the distance from the center to each vertex is equal to the distance from the center to each asymptote. Hence, we can conclude that the distance from the center to each vertex is $c$.\n\nNow let's find the slopes of the asymptotes. \n\nThe slope of the first asymptote $y = 2x - 3$ is $2$. The slope of the second asymptote $y = 17 - 2x$ is $-2$. The product of the slopes of the asymptotes is $2 \\cdot (-2) = -4$. \n\nThe relationship between the slopes of the asymptotes and the value of $c$ is given by the formula $c = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{m^2 - n^2}}$, where $m$ and $n$ are the slopes of the asymptotes. \n\nSubstituting the values of $m$ and $n$, we get $c = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{4 - (-4)^2}}= \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{4 - 16}} =\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{-12}}$. \n\nSince $a$ is the distance from the center to each vertex, and the distance between the vertices is $2a$, we can see that the distance between the foci is $2c = \\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{-12}}$.\n\nHowever, we have encountered an issue. The term $\\sqrt{-12}$ results in an imaginary number, indicating that the hyperbola is rectangular.
