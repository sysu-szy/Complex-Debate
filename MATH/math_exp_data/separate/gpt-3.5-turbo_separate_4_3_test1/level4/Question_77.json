The vertex of the parabola is $(4,-5)$, which tells us that the axis of symmetry is the vertical line $x = 4$. Since the parabola has two $x$-intercepts, we know that it opens upwards.\n\nTo determine the signs of $a$, $b$, and $c$, let's consider the positive $x$-intercept first. A positive $x$-intercept means that the corresponding $y$-coordinate is also positive. Since the parabola opens upwards, this means that the parabola will be above the $x$-axis for positive $x$-values. Therefore, the value of $y$ will be positive for positive $x$-values. We can express this mathematically by substituting a positive $x$-value and a positive $y$-value into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\nLet's choose $x = 1$. Since the $x$-intercept is a point on the parabola, $(1,0)$ will be a point on the graph. Plugging these values into the equation gives us $0 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c$, which simplifies to $0 = a + b + c$.\n\nNext, let's consider the negative $x$-intercept. A negative $x$-intercept means that the corresponding $y$-coordinate is also positive. Since the parabola opens upwards, this means that the parabola will be above the $x$-axis for negative $x$-values. Therefore, the value of $y$ will be positive for negative $x$-values. We can once again express this mathematically by substituting a negative $x$-value and a positive $y$-value into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\nLet's choose $x = -1$. Since the $x$-intercept is a point on the parabola, $(-1,0)$ will be a point on the graph.

This implies that the vertex of the parabola is below the $x$-axis. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, which is $-5$, is negative.

Therefore, the coefficient $a$ must be positive.\n\nFinally, the coefficient $b$ doesn't affect whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and it doesn't determine whether the parabola has one positive and one negative $x$-intercept.
