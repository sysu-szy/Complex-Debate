We need to find another complex number $w$ such that $zw = 1.$\n\nLet $w = c + di,$ where $c$ and $d$ are integers. Multiplying $z$ and $w$ together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nzw &= (a + bi)(c + di) \\\\\n&= ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 \\\\\n&= (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFor the product $zw$ to equal 1, we need the real part and the imaginary part of $zw$ to equal 1 and 0 respectively. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nac - bd &= 1, &(1) \\\\\nad + bc &= 0. &(2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nLet's solve this system for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$ and $d.$\n\nFrom equation $(2),$ we have $ad + bc = 0,$ so $ad = -bc.$  If $c = 0,$ then $d = 0,$ and this implies that $zw = 0,$ which is not equal to 1. Therefore, we can assume that $c$ is not equal to 0, and we can divide both sides of the equation by $c$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{ad}{c} + b &= 0, \\\\\n\\frac{ad}{c} &= -b, \\\\\nad &= -bc. \\hspace{20mm} (*)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting this into equation $(1),$ we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nac - bd &= 1, \\\\\nac + ad &= 1, \\\\\na(c + d) &= 1, \\\\\na &= \\frac{1}{c + d}. \\hspace{15mm} (**)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can substitute equations $(*)(*),$ and $(**)$ into the expressions for $a$ and $b:$\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= \\frac{1}{c + d} = \\frac{1}{c - \\frac{bc}{a}}, \\\\\nb &= -\\frac{ad}{c} = -\\frac{-\\frac{bc}{c + d}}{c} = \\frac{bd}{c + d}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can see that $z$ will be a unit if $a$ and $b$ are both integers. Thus, we need to find all $c$ and $d$ such that $c + d$ divides 1 and $c$ divides $bd.$\n\nSince $c$ divides $bd$ and $b$ divides $bd,$ we have that $bc$ divides $bd,$ and therefore $c$ divides $d.$ Hence, $d$ is a multiple of $c.$\n\nNow, let's consider the condition $c + d$ divides 1. It can only hold when $c + d = 1$ or $c + d = -1.$\n\nIf $c + d = 1,$ then $d = 1 - c,$ so $d$ is an integer. Thus, we have a valid pair of values for $c$ and $d.$\n\nIf $c + d = -1,$ then $d = -1 - c,$ so $d$ is an integer. Once again, we have a valid pair of values for $c$ and $d.$\n\nIn summary, for each integer $c,$ there are two possible values for $d$ (namely $1 - c$ and $-1 - c$) that satisfy our conditions.
