A reversible prime is a prime number that remains prime even when its digits are reversed. \n\nLet's first identify which numbers need to be checked for being reversible primes. We can exclude all single-digit prime numbers since reversing them would still result in the same number. Therefore, we can start checking reversible primes from the smallest two-digit prime number, 11.\n\nWe can systematically check each prime number greater than 17 by reversing its digits and checking if the reversed number is also prime. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\nStep 1: Start with the smallest two-digit prime number, 11.\n- Reverse the digits: 11 (remains the same).\n- Check if the reversed number is prime: Since we are dealing with the same number, we know it is prime. However, we must remember that we are looking for a reversible prime greater than 17.\n\nStep 2: Move to the next prime number, 13.\n- Reverse the digits: 31.\n- Check if the reversed number is prime: 31 is a prime number, so 13 is a reversible prime.\n\nStep 3: Move to the next prime number, 17.\n- Reverse the digits: 71.\n- Check if the reversed number is prime: 71 is a prime number, so 17 is also a reversible prime.\n\nStep 4: Move to the next prime number, 19.\n- Reverse the digits: 91.\n- Check if the reversed number is prime: 91 is not a prime number, as it is divisible by 7.

A reversible prime is a prime number that remains prime when its digits are reversed.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the prime numbers greater than 17. The prime numbers less than 17 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. However, we are looking for a prime number greater than 17, so these numbers are not eligible.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to check each prime number greater than 17 to see if it is reversible.
