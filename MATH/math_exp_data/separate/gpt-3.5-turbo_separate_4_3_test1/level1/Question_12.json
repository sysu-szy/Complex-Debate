We notice that the constant term is $7$ and its prime factorization is $7 = 7 \\cdot 1$. This suggests that the rational root theorem may be helpful in finding a linear factor of the polynomial.\n\nIndeed, by the rational root theorem, the possible rational roots of the polynomial are of the form $\\pm \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of $7$ and $q$ is a factor of $2$. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 7, \\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{7}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nChecking these possible roots, we find that $x = 1$ is a root of the polynomial (it satisfies the equation $2(1)^4 - 8(1)^3 + 7 = 0$).

We can then attempt to factor this polynomial further by looking for rational roots among the divisors of the constant term $1$, but we find that it does not have any rational roots.\n\nSince $x=1$ is a root of the polynomial $2x^4-8x^3+7$, the polynomial can be written as\n\\[(x-1)(2x^3 - 6x^2 - 6x + 1) = 0.\\]To find the other roots, we can apply the cubic formula to the cubic polynomial $2x^3 - 6x^2 - 6x + 1$.
