We will proceed in the following rounds:\n\nRound 1: Recall the definition of the tangent function. The tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle in a right triangle. Let's consider an angle $x$ such that $\\tan x = \\sqrt{3}$. \n\nRound 2: We can draw a right triangle with the angle $x$ and let the length of the side opposite $x$ be $1$ and the length of the side adjacent to $x$ be $\\sqrt{3}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. Squaring the length of the opposite side and the adjacent side, we have $1^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 + 3 = 4$. Therefore, the hypotenuse has a length of $2$.\n\nRound 3: Now, we want to find $\\arctan \\sqrt{3}$, which is the measure of angle $x$ in radians. We know that $\\tan x = \\sqrt{3}$. Using the definition of the tangent function, we have $\\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\sqrt{3}$. In our triangle, $\\text{opposite} = 1$ and $\\text{adjacent} = \\sqrt{3}$.
