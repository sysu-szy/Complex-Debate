The mistake lies in assuming that all the given equations can be solved and that the values obtained for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are valid.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the equations:\n\n1. $4^a = 5$\nThere is no integer value of $a$ that satisfies this equation. Hence, this equation does not have a solution.\n\n2. $5^b = 6$\nThis equation can be solved by taking the logarithm base $5$ of both sides:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log_5 (5^b) &= \\log_5 6 \\\\\nb &= \\log_5 6\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the change of base formula, we can rewrite this as $b = \\frac{\\log 6}{\\log 5}$. Evaluating with a calculator, we find:\n\n$b \\approx 1.26$\n\n3. $6^c = 7$\nThis equation can be solved by taking the logarithm base $6$ of both sides:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log_6 (6^c) &= \\log_6 7 \\\\\nc &= \\log_6 7\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the change of base formula, we rewrite this as $c = \\frac{\\log 7}{\\log 6}$. Evaluating with a calculator, we find:\n\n$c \\approx 1.19$\n\n4. $7^d = 8$\nThis equation can be solved by taking the logarithm base $7$ of both sides:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log_7 (7^d) &= \\log_7 8 \\\\\nd &= \\log_7 8\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the change of base formula, we rewrite this as $d = \\frac{\\log 8}{\\log 7}$. Evaluating with a calculator, we find:\n\n$d \\approx 1.08$\n\nNow we can calculate the value of $a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d$:\n\n$a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d \\approx a \\cdot 1.26 \\cdot 1.19 \\cdot 1.08$\n\nSince $a$ is undefined, the product is also undefined.\n\nTherefore, the updated answer is $\\boxed{\\text{undefined}}$."}]}
