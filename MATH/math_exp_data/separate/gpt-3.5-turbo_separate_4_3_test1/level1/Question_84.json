{"question": "Shooting hoops for 30 minutes burns 150 calories. How many calories would Kendra burn shooting hoops if she shot hoops 30 minutes every day for one week?", "answer": "Since Kendra burns 150 calories every time she shoots hoops for 30 minutes, and she does this activity 7 times during the week, the total calories burned are $150 \\times 7 = \\boxed{1050}$ calories.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the number of calories Kendra burns during one day of shooting hoops for 30 minutes.\n\nWe know that shooting hoops for 30 minutes burns 150 calories. This means that for every minute of shooting hoops, Kendra burns 150/30 = 5 calories.\n\nNow, let's find out how many calories she would burn if she shot hoops for one day, which is equivalent to shooting hoops for 30 minutes.\n\nSince she burns 5 calories per minute, Kendra would burn 5 x 30 = 150 calories in one day.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many calories she would burn in one week by shooting hoops for 30 minutes every day.\n\nThere are 7 days in one week, so to find the total number of calories burned in a week, we need to multiply the number of calories burned in one day (150 calories) by 7.\n\n150 x 7 = 1050\n\nTherefore, Kendra would burn 1050 calories shooting hoops if she shot hoops for 30 minutes every day for one week.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{1050}.", "round 1": "Let's analyze the problem and solution step by step:\n\n1. We are given that shooting hoops for 30 minutes burns 150 calories.\n2. From this information, we can determine that Kendra burns 5 calories per minute of shooting hoops since 150 divided by 30 equals 5.\n3. To find out how many calories Kendra would burn if she shot hoops for one day, we need to multiply the calories burned per minute (5) by the number of minutes in a day (30), which equals 150 calories.\n4. Since the question asks for the number of calories burned in a week, we need to multiply the calories burned in one day (150) by the number of days in a week, which is 7.\n5. The result of this multiplication is 150 multiplied by 7, which equals 1050.\n6.
