In the complex plane, a complex number $z = a + bi$ can be represented as a point $(a,b)$. The absolute value or modulus of $z$, denoted as $|z|$, is the distance from the origin to the point representing $z$ in the complex plane.\n\nUsing this definition, we are given that $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4$. This means that the distances from the origin to the points representing $a$ and $b$ are 7 and 4 respectively.\n\nNow let's consider the product $ab$. Geometrically, multiplying two complex numbers is equivalent to rotating and stretching the complex plane. The magnitude or absolute value of the product $ab$ represents the distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane that represents the result.\n\nSince $|ab|$ represents a distance, it will always be non-negative. Therefore, $|ab|$ is equal to the magnitude of $ab$. \n\nTo find $|ab|$, we need to multiply the magnitudes of $a$ and $b$. This can be seen by considering the complex numbers $a$ and $b$ as vectors. The length of the vector sum $a+b$ can be found by forming a parallelogram with sides $a$ and $b$, and the length of the parallelogram's diagonal represents the magnitude of $ab$.\n\nUsing this reasoning, we have $|ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| = 7 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{28}$.\n", "round 1": "Based on the properties of the absolute value function and complex number multiplication, we can find $|ab|$ as follows:\n\nGiven that $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4$, we can use the property $|ab| = |a|\\cdot |b|$.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n$|ab|= 7\\cdot 4 = 28$.\n\nTherefore, $|ab| = \\boxed{28}$.", "round 2": "Based on the properties of the absolute value function and complex number multiplication, we want to find $|ab|$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers with $|a| = 7$ and $|b| = 4$.\n\nWe can use the property $|ab| = |a|\\cdot |b|$.
