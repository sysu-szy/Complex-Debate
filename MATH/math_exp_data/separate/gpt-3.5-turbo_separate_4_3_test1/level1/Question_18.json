We can simplify this by combining the terms inside the parentheses.\n\nSince $x$ and $-x$ have the same magnitude but opposite signs, $x + 1 - x$ simplifies to $1$. Therefore, $(x + 1 - x)!$ becomes $1!$.\n\nRecall that the factorial of a number $n$ is denoted by $n!$. The factorial of $1$ is equal to $1$.\n\nNext, let's simplify the denominator $(x - x + 1)!$. In this case, $x$ and $-x$ have the same magnitude but opposite signs, just like in the numerator. Therefore, $x - x$ simplifies to $0$. Then we add $1$ to $0$, resulting in $1$. So, $(x - x + 1)!$ becomes $1!$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression $(x + 1 - x)! \\div (x - x + 1)!$.
