{"question": "If $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, what is the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations?", "answer": "We wish to solve for $a$ and $b$. First, multiply the second equation by $2$ and subtract it from the first. This gives $(3a - 2a) + (2b - 2b) = (5 - 4)$, or $a = 1$. Then, plugging $a = 1$ into the second equation yields $1 + b = 2$, so $b = 1$.
