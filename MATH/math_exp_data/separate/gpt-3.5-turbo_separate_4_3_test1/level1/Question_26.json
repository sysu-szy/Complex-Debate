{"question": "What is the smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$?", "answer": "To find a positive number that is both a multiple of $6$ and a multiple of $8$, we'll list out the multiples of $6$, starting with $6$, and check to see if any of them are also multiples of $8$. $6$ does not divide $8$, so it isn't a multiple of $8$. $12$ and $18$ are also not evenly divisible by $8$, so they do not work, either.  $24$ is evenly divisible by $8$ (as $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$), so $\\boxed{24}$ is the smallest positive multiple of both $6$ and $8$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To find the smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$, we need to consider the multiples of $6$ and check if they are also multiples of $8$. \n\nFirst, let's list a few multiples of $6$ and check if they are divisible by $8$:\n\n- $6$ is not divisible by $8$ since $8 \\nmid 6$.\n- $12$ is not divisible by $8$ since $8 \\nmid 12$.\n- $18$ is not divisible by $8$ since $8 \\nmid 18$.\n- $24$ is divisible by $8$ since $8 \\mid 24$.\n\nSo, we have found a multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$, which is $24$.
