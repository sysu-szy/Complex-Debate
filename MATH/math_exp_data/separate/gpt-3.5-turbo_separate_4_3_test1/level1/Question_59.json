{"question": "Kailin's favorite restaurant has a special offer on a three-course meal. A meal consists of an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The menu features five appetizers, eight entrees and four desserts. How many different three-course meals can be formed with these choices?", "answer": "There are 5 choices for an appetizer, 8 choices for an entree, and 4 choices for a dessert.
