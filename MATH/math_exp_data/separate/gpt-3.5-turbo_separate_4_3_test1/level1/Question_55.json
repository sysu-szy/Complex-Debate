A perfect square trinomial is of the form $(x+a)^2$, where $x$ represents a variable and $a$ is a constant. The square of a binomial results in a trinomial with the first term squared, the last term squared, and twice the product of the two terms.

In this case, since the constant term is a perfect square, we can conclude that the middle term is the result of doubling the product of the numbers we are looking for. \n\nThe perfect square $25$ is obtained by multiplying two equal numbers, so we need to find two equal numbers whose sum is $10$.

A perfect square trinomial has the form $(a+b)^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.
