Let's denote the number of boxes containing only pencils as P, the number of boxes containing only pens as N, and the number of boxes containing both as B.\n\nNow, we can create an equation using the given information: P + N + B = 10.\n\nFrom the problem, we are told that there are five boxes containing pencils, which means the number of boxes in the P circle is 5.
