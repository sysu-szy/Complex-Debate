This approach will allow us to simplify the problem by working with smaller numbers.\n\nWe know that to find the largest multiple of 37, we need to divide 700 by 37. Using long division, we find:\n\n<<700/37=18>>18 remainder 14\n\nThis means that 700 is 18 times 37 plus a remainder of 14. Since we want the largest multiple less than 800, we can subtract this remainder from 700 to find the largest multiple less than 700. \n\n700 - 14 = 686\n\nTherefore, the largest multiple of 37 that is less than 700 is 686. \n\nNow, to find the largest multiple of 37 that is less than 800, we can add 37 to 686 to find the next multiple of 37.\n\n686 + 37 = 723\n\nThis is the next multiple of 37, but it is greater than 800.
