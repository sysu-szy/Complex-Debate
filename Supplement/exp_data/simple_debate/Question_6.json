Basically, the function at any point $x$ is defined in terms of the function at the points $x+1$ and $x-1$. For example, if we set $x=14$, we can rewrite the equation as $f(14) = f(15) - f(13)$. Now, since we know $f(15)$, this equation tells us something about $f(14)$.\n\nParticipant 2: Yeah and we can use similar logic to find the functional values at all points before $x = 15$ by continuing to set different values for $x$ such that $x+1 = 15$. Similarly, if we set $x = 19$, we get $f(19) = f(20) - f(18)$. So we can find all functional values after $x = 20$ by setting $x+1 = 20$. \n\nParticipant 1: That's right! But before we move ahead with any computations, let's notice one more thing. Consider the difference between the functional values at two points $x$ and $y$. We have,\n$f(x) - f(y) = f(x+1) - f(x-1) - f(y+1) + f(y-1) = f(x+1) - f(y+1) + f(x-1) - f(y-1)$\nThis establishes an interesting property: the difference between the function values at two points only depends on their difference, not the absolute values.\n\nParticipant 2: So it's almost like a periodic function with period 1 since the difference repeats every unit. We can look at our given values to see this. The difference between the function values $f(15) - f(20) = 20 - 15 = 5$. And using our recurrence relation, we can calculate that $f(16) - f(19) = f(17) - f(18) = 5$ too. So it's consistent.\n\nParticipant 1: Good point! So the difference of 5 is always maintained, irrespective of the points. Now to find the answer, we need to somehow leverage this property. A possible way could be to find the relationship between $f(20) $ and $f(15)$.\n\nParticipant 2: Backtracking our recurrence relation, we have $f(20) = f(21) - f(19)$ and $f(15) = f(16) - f(14)$. We can continue backtracking until we arrive at the value $x = 17.5$ (note that x does not have to be an integer).\n\nParticipant 1: Let's see what we get. For $x=19.5$, we get $f(19.5) = f(20.5) - f(18.5)$ and for $x = 14.5$, we have $f(14.5) = f(15.5) - f(13.5)$. Keep iterating, until we reach $x=17.5$, where $f(17.5)= f(18.5) - f(16.5)$.\n\nParticipant 2: Perfect, so now we have $f(20) = f(19.5)+f(18.5)$, $f(15) = f(16.5)+f(14.5)$ and $f(18.5) = f(19.5) + f(17.5)$. This implies $f(20) - f(18.5) = f(19.5)$.\n\nParticipant 1: Already we are seeing a significant reduction in our function's vast domain. The next step could be to express the function $f$ in terms of this new average value $f(17.5)$.\n\nParticipant 2: That indeed seems to be the best approach. Let's write $f(20), f(19.5), f(19), f(18.5), f(18), ..., f(16.5), f(16),..., f(15)$ in terms of $f(17.5)$. Their sum would should result in an expression of $f(17.5)$. Let's call this sum S. We have, S = $f(20) + f(19.5) + f(19) + f(18.5) + f(18) + ... + f(16.5) + f(16)...+ f(15)$.\n\nParticipant 1: Notice that every term in the series S corresponds to a definite increment of 5 over the function value at 17.5. We have 9 terms within our range from 15 to 20, including both these points. For $f(15), f(15.5),...,f(16.5)$, the function value is $f(17.5)$ minus multiples of 5. For $f(18), f(18.5),...,f(20)$, the value is $f(17.5)$ plus multiples of 5.\n\nParticipant 2: So it's an arithmetic sequence! Using the formula for the sum, we can equate: S = 9$f(17.5)$. We calculate the sum of S to get 35, thus presenting us with the equation 9$f(17.5) = 35$.\n\nParticipant 1: We agreed our final answer should be in a simple form. So, calculating $f(17.5)$ yields $\\frac{35}{9}$.\n\nParticipant 2: Now we know $f(17.5)$, we can easily find $f(20152015) = f(17.5) + (20152015-17.5) \\cdot 5$, which equals..\n\nParticipant 1: Which equals... $\\frac{35}{9} + (20151997.5) \\cdot 5$!\n\nParticipant 2: Simplifying this, we have $\\frac{35}{9} + 100759987.5$.

This will allow us to express $f(0)$ in terms of known values of $f$. In this case, we express $f(0)$ as a difference of $f(15)$ and $f(20)$ in the following way: From the given equation, we have $f(0) = f(1) + f(-1)$. We can then find $f(1)$ and $f(-1)$ in terms of known values, by repeatedly applying the given equation.\n\nRound 4:\nWe get that $f(1) = f(2) + f(0)$ and $f(-1) = f(0) + f(-2)$.
