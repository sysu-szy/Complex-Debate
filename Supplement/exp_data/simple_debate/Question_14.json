How do we deal with this?\n\nFirst Speaker: Good point. The given equation is a weighed sum of the roots indeed. However, we can utilize it and find the sum of roots in a different way. Specifically, we can multiply each term in the given equation by the number that divides the root in the denominator, yielding:\n$r_1 + \\frac{r_2}{2} + \\frac{r_3}{5/2} + r_4 = 2$\nNow, this is closer to the form we need, the sum of roots, but not quite there yet.\n\nSecond Speaker: Okay, so we should try to get rid of the fractions. Let's multiply each term in the last equation by 2, to yield:\n$2r_1 + r_2 + \\frac{2r_3}{5} + 2r_4 = 4$\n\nThird Speaker: Almost there, guys. Notice that when we multiply each term by 2, the coefficient in front of $r_3$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$. We need it to be 1 to match the form of $a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$. How about we multiply each term by 5?\nSo, $10r_1 + 5r_2 + 2r_3 + 10r_4 = 20$\nThat's it!\n\nFirst Speaker: Great, we got it!

We obtain: $2r_1 + r_2 + \\frac{4}{5}r_3 + \\frac{1}{2}r_4 = 4$. \n\nStep 4:\nWe then multiply by 5 to clear the fraction to get $10r_1 + 5r_2 + 4r_3 + 5r_4/2 = 20$.

Applying this to the equation above gives us:\n\n$5(2n+1) + 4(2n+3) + 4(2n+5) + 5(2n+7) = 40$\n$36n + 60 = 40$\n$36n = -20$\n$n = -\\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nRound 3: \n\nHowever, we have a contradiction here, because we said that $n$ was positive, but we ended up with a negative number. That means we made a wrong assumption. The roots are not equidistant, so a different approach will be needed.\n\nRound 4: \nWe can rearrange the given equation as:\n$\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{2} + \\frac{r_3}{5} + \\frac{r_4}{5} + \\frac{r_4}{8} + \\frac{r_4}{8} + \\frac{r_4}{8} = \\frac{r_1}{2} + r_2 + \\frac{2r_3}{5} + r_4 = 1$.\nThis implies that $r_1$ is half of a root, $r_2$ is a whole root, $r_3$ is $2/5$ of a root, and $r_4$ is a whole root of the given polynomial.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that $r_2 = 2r_1$, $r_3 = \\frac{5}{2}r_1$ and $r_4 = 2r_1$.\n\nSubstituting into the given polynomial gives: $r_1 + 2r_1 + \\frac{5}{2}r_1 + 2r_1 = 1$, so $r_1 = \\frac{2}{11}$.\n\nFrom this, we now can tell that $r_1= \\frac{2}{11}$, $r_2 = \\frac{4}{11}$, $r_3 = \\frac{5}{11}$ and $r_4 = \\frac{8}{11}$.\n\nRound 5:\nSo now finding $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$ gives us $\\frac{2}{11} + \\frac{4}{11} + \\frac{5}{11} + \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{19}{11}$.\n\nSo, finally, we substitute into  $a = -4(r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4)$ to give:\n\n$a = -4* \\frac{19}{11} = \\frac{-76}{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of a is $\\boxed{-\\frac{76}{11}}$.", "round 1": "Round 1:\nTaking a look at this problem, I can see that it involves a 4th degree polynomial and the roots of that polynomial. The coefficients of the polynomial are related to the roots of the polynomial. Vieta's formulas will be helpful here.\n\nFor the polynomial $4x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - cx + 5$, Vieta's formulas will give us:\n\n$a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$\n\nWe're asked to find the value of $a$.\n\nRound 2:\nWe are given an equation in the form of a weighted sum of roots: $\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{5} + \\frac{r_4}{8} = 1$. To transform this equation into a form similar to Vieta's formula for $a$, we can multiply each term by the denominator of the respective fraction. This results in $r_1 + \\frac{r_2}{2} + \\frac{2r_3}{5} + r_4 = 2$.\n\nRound 3:\nMultiplying each term by 2 to bring each fraction closer to a whole number, we get $2r_1 + r_2 + \\frac{4r_3}{5} + 2r_4 = 4$.\n\nRound 4: \nTo solve for $a$ in the form $a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$, we need to look at the $r_3$ term in our equation. If we multiply each term by 5, the denominator in the $r_3$ term will become 1, resulting in the equation $10r_1 + 5r_2 + 2r_3 + 10r_4 = 20$.\n\nRound 5:\nThe final step to get our sum in the form $a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$ is to divide each term by 5, yielding $2r_1 + r_2 + \\frac{2}{5}r_3 + 2r_4 = 4$.\n\nRound 6:\nComparing this to Vieta's formula for $a$, we can see they match other than the $\\frac{2}{5}r_3$ term. If we multiply both sides of the given equation $\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{5} + \\frac{r_4}{8} = 1$ by 5, we obtain $2.5r_1 + 1.25r_2 + r_3 + 0.625r_4 = 5$. \n\nBy comparing both obtained equations, we see that $r_3 = \\frac{2}{5}r_3 + 0.625r_4$, so $\\frac{3}{5}r_3 = 0.625r_4$, and $r_4 = \\frac{12}{5}r_3$. Substituting this into one of the equations, we get $2r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + 2\\cdot \\frac{12}{5}r_3 = 4$, and simplifying, we finally obtain $2r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + 4.8r_3 = 4$, which simplifies as $2r_1 + r_2 + 5.8r_3 = 4$. \n\nSince this matches the form for $a$ in the Vieta's formula, we have $a = 4$. \n\nSo the solution is \\boxed{4}.", "round 2": "After reading through the solutions presented by the other agents, I could see where each of them made errors.\n\nLet's revise the solution step-by-step:\n\nGiven the polynomial:\n\\[4x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - cx + 5 = 0\\]\nhas the roots $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$ and according to Vieta's formulas, a polynomial's roots sum up to negative the coefficient of third term divided by the coefficient of the degree term, in this case, it is:\n\\[-a = -\\frac{a}{4} = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4\\]\n\nWe are also given that\n\\[\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{5} + \\frac{r_4}{8} = 1\\]\n\nWe multiply the terms of this equation by 40 to clear the fractions and to try to have it in a form closer to the sum of roots:\n\\[20r_1 + 10r_2 + 8r_3 + 5r_4 = 40\\]\n\nNext, we divide by 5 (since 5 is the least of 20, 10, 8, and 5) to reduce the coefficients of the roots closer to unity:\n\\[4r_1 + 2r_2 + \\frac{8}{5}r_3 + r_4 = 8\\]\n\nFinally, we notice that this resembles the sum of roots in Vieta's formulas. Given that $a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4$, we can equate the sum of roots to 8. However, the coefficients are different so let's multiply it by 4 to get the form we need:\n\\[4a = a = -16r_1 - 8r_2 - \\frac{32}{5}r_3 -4r_4 = -4 * 8 = -32\\]\n\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, $-a = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = -32$. Therefore, $a = \\boxed{32}$."}]}
