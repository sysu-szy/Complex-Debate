The shop is selling 500 smartphones each week at a price of $450 each. A decrease of $5 in price will result in sale of 10 more smartphones. So, we need to find the price at which the revenue (product of price and quantity sold) will be maximum.\n\nLet the number of decreases in price by $5 be x. The selling price of a smartphone when decreased by $5 x times from $450 would be $(450-5x)$. With every decrease in price by $5, the quantity sold will increase by 10 units. So, the total quantity sold will be $500+10x$.\n  \nThe revenue (R) is equal to the price of each smartphone multiplied by the number sold, so \nR = (450-5x)*(500+10x)\n\nRound 2: Simplify the equation\nNext, we will simplify the equation to make it easier to work with. \nBy using the distributive property, we get \nR = 450*500 + 450*10x - 5x*500 - 5x*10x\nThis simplifies further to \nR = 225,000 + 4500x - 2500x - 50x^2 = -50x^2 + 2000x + 225,000\n\nRound 3: Take the derivative and set it to zero\n\nIt is a routine method in calculus that if a function is maximized or minimized, its derivative is zero. Therefore, to find the price where revenue is maximized, we take the derivative of the revenue equation and set it to zero.\n\nThe derivative of -50x^2 + 2000x + 225,000 = 0 is -100x + 2000 = 0\n\nSolving the above equation for x gives x = \\boxed{20}\n\nRound 4: Interpret the result\nNow x equals 20 means that the price was decreased 20 times by $5 each time. So, if we subtract $5 twenty times from the initial price of $450, the new price comes to $450 - 5*20 = \\$400\n\nSo, the price of the smartphone that would result in maximum revenue would be \\boxed{400}.", "round 1": "By comparing all of the solutions from other agents, we can see that there is a discrepancy in the interpretation of the variable x.
