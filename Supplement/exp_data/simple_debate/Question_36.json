{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.

This is because any positive integer 'n' can be represented uniquely as a product of prime factors. The divisors of 'n' are the various combinations of these prime factors.\n\nStep 3: Relating divisors to the given condition\nNext, we recognize that the product of the divisors of any integer 'n' can be calculated as 'n' raised to the number of divisors divided by 2. This can be deduced from the properties of numbers and prime factorizations.\n\nSince the question states the product of the divisors equals 'n to the 6th', this means that the number of divisors of 'n' over 2 must be 6.

Since the product of the divisors in this case is 'n to the 6th power', this means the total number of divisors of 'n' is twice 6, i.e., 12.\n\nStep 3: Explore possibilities\nThe number of divisors can be found from the prime factorization of 'n'.\nLet's denote 'n' as $p_1^{e_1} * p_2^{e_2} * ... * p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1, p_2,..., p_k$ are prime numbers, and $e_1, e_2,..., e_k$ are their respective exponents.

However, with this rule, the prime factorization of n must be distinct primes, otherwise the rule would no longer hold.\n\nAgent Solution2 has a similar error to solution 1 by wrongly stating that $e_i*(e_i + 1)/2 = 6e_i$ for every i, when that doesn't seem to follow from the previous equations. They then wrongly infer from this that the smallest possible $n=2^{11}$, which is incorrect.\n\nAgent Solution3 shows misunderstanding in correctly defining the powers of n and therefore draws incorrect conclusions from the prime factorization, wrongly concluding that n must be 32.\n\nFinally, among all submissions, Agent Solution0 has the correct answer and correct reasoning to the problem:\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer n whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$ is \\boxed{64}.", "round 2": "Let's consider the prompt:\n\nWe are asked to find the smallest positive integer $n > 1$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$.\n\nThis is equivalent to $\\prod_{d|n} d = n^6$, where $\\prod_{d|n} d$ denotes the product of the divisors of $n$.\n\nAs reasoned in some of the previous solutions, since $n > 1$, the divisors of $n$ are the various combinations of the prime factors of $n$.\n\nEach divisor of $n$ can be written as $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ such that $0 \\leq a_i \\leq e_i$ where $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n$, which we'll call $d$, is given by $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$.\n\nIn number theory, the product of all the divisors of a number is equal to the number to the power of half of its total number of divisors.\n\nSo we have $n^{d/2} = n^6$, which simplifies to $d = 12$.\n\nAssuming the exponent of each distinct prime in the prime factorization of n is from the list of factors of 12, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\n1) For 1 and 12, we can consider 11 primes raised to the power of 1 and one to the power of 12. However, as shown in some previous solutions, $2^{12}$ would already be larger than some other configurations of primes and exponents, so we need to rule it out.\n\n2) For 2 and 6, the smallest combination would be two primes each to the power of 6, but $2^6 \\cdot 3^6$ is also evidently larger than some other configurations still to be considered.\n\n3) For 3 and 4, we can consider the first three smallest primes, where n equals $2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^4$. This configuration is not minimal.\n\n4) For 1, 2, 2, 3, here we have four different prime numbers, each raised to powers of 2 and then raised to power of 3. It would be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2$, which is clearly greater than when we use 1, 1, 1 and 12. \n\nHence, the minimal positive integer is not in the form of $p_1^{2}p_2^{2}\\cdots p_k^{2}$ with k equal to 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nNext, consider only the prime number 2 and the powers of 2.\n\nIt is known that the product of divisors of $2^{e}$ is $(2^{e})^{(e+1)/2}$, equating this to $n^6$ we get $(2^{2e(e+1)}) = n^{12}$. By comparing the exponents of both sides, we get that $2e(e+1) = 12$, which solves to $e = 3$ and hence $n = 2^e = 2^3 = 8$, but upon checking, this doesn't work.\n\nSo it remains that we've yet to consider the scenario where the exponent of each distinct prime in the prime factorization of n is the same, namely in the form $p^e$. \n\nBy examining $2^6$ we observe that $\\prod_{d|2^6} d = (2^6)^6$, which manifests that $n = 2^6 = 64$ is a solution to the problem and indeed the smallest one. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer n whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$ is \\boxed{64}."}]}
