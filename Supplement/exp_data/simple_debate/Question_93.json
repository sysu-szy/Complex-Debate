Agent solution1 and solution3 notice the problem that the function is not currently strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, the correction propagation could make the function invertible. Agent solution2 emphasis on the observation of adjacent slopes. And solution0 gives a more precise criterion and do the computation correctly.\n\nFrom this argument, the problem requires that the final functions be invertible, which means the final functions must be strictly monotonic: strictly increasing or decreasing. This can be achieved because a line with a constant slope added to a piecewise linear function is still piecewise linear - the kinks (discontinuities in the derivative) are preserved. The slope of each segment will be adjusted by the same amount.\n\nAs in solution1 and solution3's arguments, for $g(x)$, we want $a$ to be a sufficiently negative integer. This is because the slope of the first segment from the left is positive, and the slope of the second segment from the first kink (discontinuity in the derivative) to the second kink is negative, and so on. The slope of each segment from the third kink onward is again positive. Adding a sufficiently negative $a$ ensures that all slopes become negative.\n\nThe largest possible value of $a$ (which is negative, hence \"largest\") ensures that, following our addition, two critical segments remain with distinct slopes. In our scenario, these two segments are the upward sloping segment to the right of $x=1$, and the downward sloping segment between $x=-1$ and $x=1$.\n\nThe original slopes are $-4$ and $3$ and they are $7$ apart. To make them distinct after adding $a$, we need to select $a$ such that it is less than the midpoint between $-4$ and $3$. Thus, the largest possible $a$ is at most $-4 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7}{2} \\right\\rfloor = -1$, which is the greatest negative integer not greater than the actual midpoint.\n\nSimilarly, to find $b$, we apply the same reasoning. But here, we want $b$ to be a sufficiently positive integer to ensure the slopes of all the segments are positive, as the function $h(x)$ needs to be strictly increasing. Thus we need to select $b$ to be sufficiently greater than the maximum negative slope of $-4$. \n\nFor the two downward-sloping segments, however, we notice that they have distinctly negative slopes of $-4$ and $-2$. As with the case of $a$ , segment slopes must remain distinct following the addition of $b$ to each slope. Therefore, their slopes, $-4+b$ and $-2+b$ , are still distinct, hence $b$ must be no more than $2$ units less than the midpoint between $-4$ and $-2$ . This reasoning, then, gives us $b=\\left\\lceil -4 + \\frac{2}{2} \\right\\rceil = 0$.\n\nWhen we substitute $a$ into $a^2$, and $b$ into $b^2$, and sum $a^2$ and $b^2$, we find  $(-1)^2+0^2=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final updated answer is $\\boxed{1}$."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: \nFunction $f$ is invertible if and only if it is increasing or decreasing, that is to say, if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Looking at the graph, it's clear that $f$ is currently neither of these, due to the flat section between x = 3 and x = 5. To make it strictly increasing or decreasing, we must either lower or raise this flat section.\n\nRound 2: \nThe function $g(x) = f(x) + ax$ reduces to a line with a y-intercept of 0 and a slope of $a.$ Likewise, the function $h(x) = f(x) + bx$ reduces to a line with a y-intercept of 0 and a slope of $b.$ If we want these functions to be strictly increasing or decreasing, then we want their slopes to be non-zero. In other words, we want $a$ and $b$ to be non-zero.\n\nRound 3: \nInvertible functions must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Given the negative slope on the left side of the graph (-3 to -2), and the positive slope on the right side of the graph (0 to 3), we want a to be a negative value and b to be a positive value. This ensures g(x) is strictly decreasing and h(x) is strictly increasing.\n\nRound 4:\nFor $g(x) = f(x) + ax$ to be invertible, $a$ should be a negative integer. And $a$ needs to be the greatest negative integer such that lines on the graph of $g(x)$ have no two with the same slope. Looking at the graph, the slope of segment (-1,3)(-2,5) is 2. Therefore, $a$ needs to be less than -2 to make g(x) strictly decreasing. The first integer to satisfy this is -3, hence $a = -3$.\n\nRound 5:\nSimilarly, for $h(x) = f(x) + bx$ to be invertible, b should be a positive integer. The slope of the segment (-5, -4) and (-2, 5) is 3. Therefore, $b$ needs to be greater than 3 to make h(x) strictly increasing.

Here, let's focus on the main strategy of each solution.\n\nAgent solution1 points out that $f$ is not currently strictly increasing or decreasing, and suggests changing the slope of the flat segment by changes due to $a$ or $b$. This mostly correct but the agent does not follow this guideline consistently to arrive at correct $a$ and $b$. \n\nAgent solution2 looks at the adjacent slopes and argues we need to change the slopes of the segments far enough apart to be distinct. This is a good starting point. They also correctly points out that every line segment must have a unique slope to achieve one-to-one correspondence once we add $a$ or $b$. However, the reasoning is not completely correct, as the agent presents that $a$ and $b$ should be strictly greater than the gap between each pair of slopes, while it only needs to be greater than half of it.\n\nAgent solution0 correctly recognized the behavior of $f$ in the intervals $(-\\infty,1]$ and $[1,\\infty)$. However, the agent failed to generalize it properly to infer the effects of $a$ and $b$.\n\nAgent solution3 offers a good theoretical background for the problem and also deals correctly with the flat segment at $x = 3$.\n\nAdopting the correct ideas from the above solutions, let's proceed:\n\nThe function $f$ is not currently strictly increasing or strictly decreasing due to two segments with the negative slope and one flat segment. When we adjust the function by $a$ or $b$, we effectively change the slope of every segment by $a$ or $b$, respectively. For $g(x)$ to be invertible, we aim for a strictly decreasing function (as the slope of $f$ is positive to the left of the peak and negative to the right). Therefore, we want $a$ to be a sufficiently large negative number. For $h(x)$ to be invertible, we aim for a strictly increasing function (as the slope of $f$ is negative to the left of the peak and positive to the right). Therefore, we want $b$ to be a sufficiently large positive number.\n\nFirst, consider the slopes of the five segments from left to right: $3, -2, -4, 7, 0$. To avoid having equal slopes after addition of $a$ or $b$, the absolute difference between $a$ or $b$ and any pair of original slopes should be greater than $1$ (as the difference of integer slopes must be at least 1). This ensures that after shifting the slopes by $a$ or $b$, no two slopes will be equal.\n\nFor $a$, the closest original slopes are $-2$ and $-4$, which are $2$ apart. Therefore, an integer $a$ must be less than $-2$ to push these sufficiently apart to become unique. The largest such negative integer is $a = -3$.\n\nFor $b$, the closest original slopes are $0$ and $7$, which are $7$ apart. Therefore, an integer $b$ must be more than $7$ to push these sufficiently apart to become unique. The smallest such positive integer is $b = 8$.\n\nFinally, we compute $a^2 + b^2 = (-3)^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 64 =\\boxed{73}$.", "round 2": "The solution to our problem revolves around the analysis of the slopes of the line segments in the given graph of $f(x)$ and determining the right values of $a$ and $b$ to ensure the invertibility of functions $g(x) = f(x) + ax$ and $h(x) = f(x) + bx$.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the slopes of $f(x)$\nThe slopes of the line segments of $f(x)$, from left to right, are 3, -2, -3, 3, and 0. The key point here is that the slope of each segment will change by the same quantity, $a$ or $b$, when we construct the functions $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. So, we want to choose $a$ and $b$ such that no two segments of $g(x)$ or $h(x)$ have the same slope, ensuring their invertibility.\n\nStep 2: Finding $a$\nThe function $g(x) = f(x) + ax$ needs to be strictly decreasing, so we are looking for a negative $a$. The smallest slope in $f(x)$ is -3, and to maintain distinct slopes after addition of $a$, we can at maximum have $a = -3 - (-2) = -1$, where -2 is the next larger slope after -3. Thus the largest negative integer less than -1 is $a = -2$.\n\nStep 3: Finding $b$\nThe function $h(x) = f(x) + bx$ needs to be strictly increasing, so we are looking for a positive $b$. The largest slope in $f(x)$ is 3, and to maintain distinct slopes after addition of $b$, we can at minimum have $b = 3 - 3 = 0$, where 0 is the next smaller slope after 3. But we need $b$ to be positive, so the smallest positive integer greater than 0 is $b = 1$.\n\nStep 4: Computing $a^2 + b^2$\nReplacing $a = -2$ and $b = 1$ into the expression $a^2 + b^2$ gives us $(-2)^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$."}, {"round 0": "According to the definition of an invertible function, a function is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.

However, since the value of $x$ only influences the slope of the function $f(x)$ and not its range, we do not need to worry about whether the functions are onto. Thus, we only need to determine the largest negative integer $a$ and smallest positive integer $b$ such that the line segments in the graph of $f(x)$ have different slopes.\n\nWe can observe from the graph that the slopes of the lines segment are from left to right: $3, -2, -4, 7,$ and $0$.\n\nTo ensure the new function $f(x)+ax$ is invertible, each new line segment should have different slopes. Each original slope is shifted by $a$ into a new slope, hence no two original slopes can be less than $|a|$ apart. It is clear that there are slopes $2$ apart ($3$ and $1$), so $a$ has to be $-1$ or smaller. The largest neighboring gap among the original slopes is between $-2$ and $0$, and between $0$ and $2$, so $|a|$ can be at most $2$. Therefore, the largest $a$ such that $f(x)+ax$ is invertible can only be $-1$.\n\nSimilarly, to obtain the minimum positive integer $b$, we use the same idea. Now $3$ and $-4$ are $7$ apart, but we can let $b=8$ to make the function one-to-one.

Looking at the red line in the picture, it first increases, then decreases and then increases again, it is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing. Therefore, certain transformations are needed to make the function $f(x)$ invertible.\n\nJust because $f(x)$ is non-decreasing on $(-\\infty,1]$ and non-increasing on $[1,\\infty)$, it still won't be invertible if we just consider this interval. Drawing a horizontal line on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, it will intersect with the function in more than one place, violating the horizontal line test.\n\nRound 2: Transformation using the function $g(x)$\n\nApplying the transformation $g(x)=f(x)+ax$, this will shift the lines according to $a$ for every $x$, as $ax$ represents a line. Specifically, this will change the slopes of each line segment in the original graph. As the function needs to be monotonically decreasing, we are looking at the 'flattest' of the positive slopes, which gives us line segment (-1,3)(1,-5), with a slope of -4. As such, $a$ should be less than 4 to maintain the decrease.

We want to make $g(x)$ strictly decreasing, so we want to add a sufficiently large negative value to the slopes to tune them. Looking at the pair of slopes with smallest difference, namely $-4$ and $-2$, we observe that we need to shift down by more than $1$ (to make them distinct and satisfy the horizontal line test). As $a$ must be an integer, we can take $a=-3$ as the largest negative integer that gives us a function $g(x)$ that is strictly decreasing.\n\nStep 3: Transforming with $h(x)$\nNext, consider the function $h(x)=f(x)+bx$.

However, for real functions in calculus like $g$ and $h$, we only need to ensure the function is one-to-one, as the surjectivity is already guaranteed. A function is one-to-one if it always increases or decreases (in other words, it does not have a slope of zero or the sign of slope does not change). \n\nRound 2: \n\nGiven $g(x)=f(x)+ax$ and $h(x)=f(x)+bx$, their derivative functions are $g'(x)=f'(x)+a$ and $h'(x)=f'(x)+b$. To make $g$ and $h$ one-to-one, we need $g'(x) \\ne 0$ and $h'(x) \\ne 0$ for all $x$. As we can see from the graph, $f'(x)$ changes its sign at $x=-2$, $x=-1$, $x=1$, and $x=3$. All the other values of $x$ will have a constant sign for their derivative either positive or negative.\n\nRound 3: \n\nWhen we add a line with slope $a$ or $b$ to $f(x)$, it is equivalent to shifting the slopes of all line segments of $f(x)$ by a constant. So, we want to find the range of values of $a$ and $b$ that will prevent the derivative of $g$ or $h$ from being zero or changing sign.

If we substitute the values we found for $a$ and $b$ into this expression, we get $(-3)^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = \\boxed{25}$.", "round 2": "From the graph, we observe that the slopes of the five line segments from left to right are $3,-2,-3,3,0$ - this will be pertinent to our discussion later. The key observation is that the function $f(x)$ is not invertible; however, by changing the slopes of the line segments we can make it invertible.\n\nTo begin, consider the transformations $g(x) = f(x) + ax$ and $h(x) = f(x) + bx$. These transformations impact the slopes of the original line segments. They effectively increase (or decrease) the slope of each segment by a uniform amount of $a$ or $b$ respectively. For instance, $a$ adds to the slope of each segment value, which leads to the following modified slopes: $3+a,-2+a,-3+a,3+a,0+a$.\n\nAs $g(x)$ needs to be a strictly decreasing function, $a$ needs to be so negative as to turn all line segment slopes negative. Recalling that the steepest positive slope in $f(x)$ is $3$, the largest negative integer $a$ which makes all $g(x)$'s slopes negative is $a=-4$. However, we must also ensure that no two slopes in the transformed $g(x)$ are the same. Looking over the modified slopes, we see that \"-4-a\" and \"3-a\" would potentially be equal. To avoid this predicament, we set $a=-3$. Therefore, $-3$ is the largest negative integer for which $g(x)$ is invertible.\n\nConversely, for $h(x)$, we aim for a strictly increasing function. Thus, we need $b$ to be sufficiently positive such that all segment slopes become positive. Given the steepest negative slope in $f(x)$ is $-3$, the smallest positive integer to make all $h(x)$'s slopes positive is $b=4$. However, as before, we need to avoid having two equal slopes in the transformed function. Considering $3+b$ and $0+b$, we see that they will potentially be equal. Hence, to get around this problem we set $b=5$, the smallest positive integer for which $h(x)$ is invertible.\n\nFinally, substituting $a=-3$ and $b=5$ into the expression $a^2 + b^2$ yields $(-3)^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = \\boxed{34}$."}]}
