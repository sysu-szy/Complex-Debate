{"question": "Two weeks ago, Alice came home from vacation and noticed that a bean plant was growing in her garden. Today, the stalk is $452$ centimeters tall, and Alice observed that its height increases by $5\\%$ every day.  How tall was the plant $2$ weeks ago when she first noticed it growing?

We can work backwards to find the previous size of the plant.  We can reverse the compound interest formula to solve this problem, as if the plant loses five percent of its height every day for $14$ days.  So the height of the plant two weeks ago is equal to $$452\\div(1+0.05)^{14}= 452\\div1.98=228.29$$So, the bean plant was $\\boxed{228.3}$ centimeters tall when Alice first found it.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\n\nLet's denote the height of the plant two weeks ago as $H$, so we want to find the value of this variable. \n\nAccording to the problem, the plants growth can be represented by the formula $Ht=H(1+0.05)^t$, where $t$ is the number of days since Alice came back from vacation. \n\nSince we know that the current height of the plant is $452$ centimeters and that two weeks is equivalent to $14$ days, we can write the equation $452=H(1+0.05)^{14}$. \n\nRound 2:\n\nNext, we want to solve for $H$.
