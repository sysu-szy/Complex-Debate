{"question": "Chris labels every lattice point in the coordinate plane with the square of the distance from the point to the origin (a lattice point is a point such that both of its coordinates are integers). How many times does he label a point with the number $25$?", "answer": "Consider the point $(x,y)$. Then, he labels the point with the number $$(\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2})^2 = x^2 + y^2,$$ so it follows that $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. From here, some casework needs to be done to find the number of pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. We note that $x^2 = 25 - y^2 \\le 25 \\Longrightarrow |x| \\le 5$, and so $|x|$ can only be equal to $0,1,2,3,4,5$. Of these, only $0,3,4,5$ produce integer solutions for $|y|$.\n\nIf $|x| = 3$, then $|y| = 4$, and any of the four combinations $(3,4)(-3,4)(3,-4)(-3,-4)$ work. Similarly, if $|x| = 4, |y| = 3$, there are four feasible distinct combinations.\n\nIf $|x| = 0$, then $|y| = 5$, but then there is only one possible value for $x$, and so there are only two combinations that work: $(0,5)$ and $(0,-5)$.

In the context of the coordinate plane, the distance from a point $(x,y)$ to the origin $(0,0)$, denoted as $d$, is derived from the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\n\nHere we are interested in $d^2$:\n\n$d^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 25$.\n\nSo essentially, Chris is labelling points $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane for which $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. The set of these points comprises a circle centered at the origin with radius 5. We need to find lattice points on this circle, that is, points with integer coordinates.\n\nRound 2:\nAs a next step, let's look at the solutions to the equation $x^2 + y^2=25$. Keeping in mind that $x$ and $y$ have to be integers, we can identify the following pairs: $(5,0)$, $(-5,0)$, $(0,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(3,4)$, $(-3,-4)$, $(3,-4)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(-4,-3)$, $(4,-3)$, $(4,3)$, $(-4,3)$.

They are: $(\u00b15, 0)$, $(0, \u00b15)$, $(\u00b13, \u00b14)$, and $(\u00b14, \u00b13)$, each pair featuring two versions because of the \u00b1 symbol.\n\nWe then do the counting: there are 4 versions coming from $(\u00b15, 0)$ and $(0, \u00b15)$ (each of the two points +5 and -5 for x and y).
