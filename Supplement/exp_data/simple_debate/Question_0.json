Subtract the second equation from the first we obtain $-45 = -15p$.\n\nDebater 1: So, if we divide both sides of the equation by $-15$, we get $p = 3$. Thus, we immediately know that $p = 3$ is true. \n\nDebater 2: And if we substitute $p=3$ into the first equation $154q - 66 = 7p + 3$, we get $154q - 66 = 7*3 + 3$, which simplifies to $154q - 66 = 24$. \n\nDebater 1: Yes, if we add $66$ to both sides of this equation, we get $154q = 90$.
