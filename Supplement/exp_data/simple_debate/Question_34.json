{"question": "How many different positive integers divisible by 4 can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits? For example, 12 counts, but 512 does not.", "answer": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \n\nFirstly, we need to consider the rule that in a number divisible by 4, the last two digits must also form a number divisible by 4.

They are 12, 24 and 32.\n\nSecondly, for each of these pairs, we need to consider the number of ways we can arrange the remaining digits. If, for instance, 24 is at the end of our four-digit number, we have 13 as the remaining pair that can be arranged in two ways: either as 31 or 13.
