Similarly, line segments BE and DG are parallel. \n\nRound 2: Use the properties of parallel lines to consider the angles.\n\nSince CD is parallel to EH, angle BHD is equal to angle DCD (corresponding angles). We can conclude that angle BHD is 90 degrees since DCD, being part of the square, is 90 degrees. By similar reasoning, recognizing that BE and DG are parallel and intersecting lines create corresponding angles DBH and ECB (which are 90 degrees in the square), we discern DBH is also 90 degrees. \n\nTherefore, triangle BHD is a right triangle.\n\nRound 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nBecause triangle BHD is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of line segment BH (the hypotenuse).
