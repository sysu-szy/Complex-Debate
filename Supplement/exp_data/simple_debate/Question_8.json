{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.

So the problem is essentially asking us to find the smallest positive integer n for which divisor(n)/2 = 6, because n raised to the power 6 is the given product of its divisors.\n\nThird Participant:\nCorrect. And because n>1, the smallest solution should be a highly composite number with divisor(n) = 12, because 12 divided by 2 is equal to 6. Looking at highly composite numbers, we can see that the smallest highly composite number with 12 divisors is 60.\n\nFourth Participant:\nYes, and we can verify this by listing out all 12 divisors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.

That is, n = $p_1^{a1} * p_2^{a2} *...* p_n^{an}$.\nNow, every divisor of n is a product of some subset of these prime factors and so the product of the divisors is the product of all subsets of prime factors. \n\nRound 2 - Speaker B: \nThat's correct. And it's also true that for each prime $p_i$, the number of times it appears in some subset is a multiple of $(ai + 1)$. This is because each subset of the prime $p_i$'s exponents will include $p_i^k$ for $k$ ranging from $0$ to $ai$. So the product of all subsets is $p_i^{(ai+1)*ai/2}$ because we're summing up all exponents from $0$ to $ai$ of $p_i$, each $(ai+1)$ times.\n\nRound 3 - Speaker A: \nYou are correct. Hence, if the product of all positive divisors of $n$ is $n^6$, then for every prime factor $p_i$ we have $(p_i^{ai*(ai+1)/2})^2 = p_i^{6*(ai +1)}$. From here, we can simplify and get that $ai * (ai + 1) = 12 * (ai + 1)$.\n\nRound 4 - Speaker B: \nSo $ai = 12$. As a result, $n$ must be a product of prime powers, each to the 12th power. The smallest such prime is 2, so the smallest possible value for $n$ is $2^{12}$. So, the correct answer is $2^{12}$.\n\nSo we have the final answer in the form \\boxed{2^{12}}.", "round 1": "Based on the debate, let's go over some key points to agree with a solution. First, it's established that the product of an integer's positive divisors can be represented as the integer raised to the power of half the number of its divisors, which pairs each divisor with its counterpart. This agreement was developed by logic and some knowledge regarding divisibility and products.\n\nLet's denote the number of divisors of n as d(n). Thus, the product of n's divisors is n^(d(n)/2). It's given that this product equals n^6 implying that d(n)/2 = 6 and therefore d(n) = 12.\n\nTo minimize n, we should consider small primes since larger primes would give a larger product. The divisors of n will be combinations of these primes and their powers.\n\nGiven that d(n) is equal to 12, we can safely assume that n is a product of primes raised to certain powers. For example, n = p^11 has 12 divisors, namely p^0, p^1,..., p^11. However, using n = p^11, where p is the smallest prime (aka 2), gives a larger number than required. \n\nAnother case to consider is the 4th power of a square of a prime due to the equivalences (a*b)^2 = a^2 * b^2 and d(ab) = d(a) * d(b). In our case, we can take n to be a square of a prime to the power of 3, where each factor would provide 2 and 4 divisors respectively, getting us the required 12 in total. Thus, taking the smallest prime, n = (2^2) ^3 = 2^6 gives a larger number.\n\nThe last situation to consider occurs when the multiplied factors n = abc is a product of three different primes. Each such prime contributes two divisors, achieving the total required. In this case, taking the first 3 primes would make n = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30, which still exceeds our desired number.\n\nFrom these considerations, we can see that n should be the product of 2 distinct primes p1 and p2 each raised to a power between 1 and 2. This leads us to n = p1^a * p2^b. The number of divisors is then (a+1)*(b+1). Since we want 12 divisors, {a+1, b+1} could be {1,12}, {2,6}, {3, 4}, or {4, 3}. The smallest case turnout to be when a=1 and b=3, with n=2 * 3^3 = 54. But 54 is smaller than our desired number.\n\nHence from the above arguments, the smallest n should be a cube of a prime. For that, the smallest prime is 2. Hence, the smallest n is 2^3 = 8. However, 8 does not satisfy our original condition of having 12 total divisors.\n\nThe only argument that stands valid and has been logically agreed by all participants is the first, which leads to n = 60.
