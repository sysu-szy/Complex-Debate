Using this fact, we see that because $\\cos 20^\\circ$ is a root of the polynomial, so are $\\cos 160^\\circ$ and $\\cos 200^\\circ$ (since these are the supplementary angles to $20^\\circ$). \n\nRound Two: \nMoreover, remember that $\\cos(180^\\circ - \\theta) = -\\cos\\theta$ and $\\cos(180^\\circ + \\theta) = -\\cos\\theta$. Thus, $-\\cos 20^\\circ$ is also a root of the polynomial, in addition to $\\cos 20^\\circ$.\n\nRound Three: \nInterestingly, these are all of the roots of the polynomial, because we know the polynomial is cubic, and therefore can have at most three roots. It follows that the polynomial can be expressed as \n\n$p(x)=k(x-\\cos20^\\circ)(x-\\cos160^\\circ)(x-\\cos200^\\circ)$, \n\nwhere $k$ is some constant. We are given that the coefficient of $x^3$ should be positive, which makes $k=1$ because if $k$ were negative, flipping all the signs of the roots wouldn't make the leading coefficient positive.\n\nRound Four: \nWe just said that the roots are $\\cos 20^\\circ$, $\\cos 160^\\circ$ and $\\cos 200^\\circ$, but if we simplify the last two cosines we get that they are also equal to $-\\cos 20^\\circ$ due to the cosine properties.

Substituting this into our polynomial gives\n\n$p(x) = (x^2 - 1 + \\frac{1+\\cos 140}{2})(x+\\cos 20^\\circ) = (x^2 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\cos 140^\\circ}{2})(x+\\cos 20^\\circ)$.\n\nFinally, since $\\cos 140^\\circ = -\\cos 40^\\circ$, we get\n\n$p(x) = (x^2 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\cos 40^\\circ}{2})(x+\\cos 20^\\circ)$.\n\nLast Round:\nTo finish this problem, use the sum-to-product identity: $\\cos a - \\cos b = -2\\sin((a+b)/2)\\sin((a-b)/2)$, which gives us $\\cos 20^\\circ - \\cos 40^\\circ = -2\\sin 30^\\circ \\cdot \\sin (-10^\\circ) = -(-\\sqrt{3}/2) = \\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nSo \n\n$p(x) = (2x^2 - 1 - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\cos 20^\\circ)$. \n\nThe only thing that easier way to make this polynomial have integer coefficients is when $\\cos 20^\\circ$ equals to $-1/2$ which is not true.
