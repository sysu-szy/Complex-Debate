When examining $x^3$ as a factor for this, we need to find $x$ to the power of 3 which can be made from the prime factorization of $10!$.\n\nRound 2:\nThe prime factorization of $10!$ could be obtained by factoring each of the individual terms. Doing this, we get $2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\cdot 5^{2} \\cdot 7$. Notice that for $x$ to be cubed and still divide evenly into $10!$, $x$ must be comprised of primes each raised to some multiple of three.\n\nRound 3:\nWithin the prime factors of $10!$, we can identify several subgroups where the prime numbers have a power of three or more. Those primes are $2^3 (which can be obtained twice from $2^8)$ and $3^3$. Hence any positive integer formed by these factors raised to power 3 would be a possible value for $x$. Notably, we are not able to take $5^3$ or $7^3$ since they do not appear in our prime factorization of $10!$.\n\nFinal Round:\nWe should now identify how many possibilities for $x$ exist from these factors. From the two appearances of $2^3$, there is $2$, $2^2$, and $2^3$. From the single appearance of $3^3$, there is $3$ and $3^2$. There isn't any restriction on how many of the factors we can use at once, so for each factor, we have the choice of either selecting it or not. \nCalculating that out, we get $(1+3)(1+2) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$. But we've clearly over-counted. We've counted the case $x=1$, but since it doesn't appear in the prime factorization of $10!$, we subtract it from the total.

Here it is $2^{8}$, $3^{4}$, $5^{2}$ and $7^{1}$.\n\nNext, we are supposed to identify possible integers that can be cubes, which will be factors of $10!$. The prime factors of $10!$ less than or equal to $3$ times their maximum powers are $2^3$, $2^3$ and $3^3$. \n\nFrom there, we form possible values of $x$ from these prime factors that might exist within the limit of $x^3$ being a factor of $10!$. For $2^3$ which repeats twice, we have the cubes $2$, $2^2$ and $2^3$. For $3^3$ we also have the cubes $3$ and $3^2$. Including the original number as an option, there are 4 options for each.\n\nSo, we would get a total of $4 \\times 3 = 12$ possible integer values for $x$.

Therefore, $10! = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\cdot 5^{2} \\cdot 7$.\n\nNext, we want $x^3$ to be a factor of $10!$. For this to be possible, each prime factor of $x$ should occur at least three times in the prime factorization. Note that $10!$ contains only four prime numbers: $2$, $3$, $5$ and $7$. The powers of $2$, $3$, $5$ and $7$ are $8$, $4$, $2$ and $1$, respectively. Prime numbers $5$ and $7$ can be ignored, as they do not occur three times in the prime factorization of $10!$.\n\nWe can divide the powers of $2$ and $3$ by $3$ since $x^3$ has to be a divisor of $10!$. Therefore, we get $8/3 = 2$ and $4/3 = 1$, respectively. Because powers cannot be fractions, we round it down, removing the fraction part. This means that the power of $2$ can be chosen from ${0,1,2}$ (total $3$ choices), and the power of $3$ can be chosen from ${0, 1}$ (total $2$ choices).\n\nBy taking every combination of the powers of $2$ and $3$, we can find $3*2=6$ different combinations. As $2^{3*2}=8^2=64$, which is less than $10!$, we have to count the possibilities of $8$ again. Using similar steps for $8$, we get another $3*2=6$ possibilities. Therefore, the total combinations of $2$ and $3$ being $x$ is $6+6=12$.\n\nHowever, these counts include $x = 1$ (power of $0$), which is not considered in this question.
