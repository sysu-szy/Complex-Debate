The point from which the tangents are drawn is $(1,3)$, therefore $y_1 = 3$. As a result, the equation of the tangent line becomes $3y=2x(x+1)$.\n\nRound 2:\nPoint $A$ is one of the points on the parabola where the tangent line touches. So, substituting $A = (x,y)$ into the tangent equation gives $3y = 2x^2 + 2x$ or $2x^2 + 2x - 3y = 0$. Furthermore, since $A$ also lies on the parabola $y^2 = 4x$, we can substitute $y$ from the parabola into our tangent equation and simplify to find possible $x$ values.\n\nRound 3:\nPlugging $y = 2\\sqrt{x}$ into our tangent equation simplifies to $x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x = 0$. \nSolving this cubic equation for its roots we get that $x = 0, 2 - \\sqrt{5}, 2 + \\sqrt{5}$. \n\nRound 4:\nSince the parabola only includes $x \\geq 0$, we reject the root $x = 2 - \\sqrt{5}$. So, the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $0$ and $2 + \\sqrt{5}$, respectively. \nBy plugging these $x$ values into the parabola equation, we get corresponding $y$ values.\n\nFor $A = (0,y_A)$, we get $y_A = \\sqrt{4*0} = 0$ and for $B = (2 + \\sqrt{5},y_B)$, we get $y_B = \\sqrt{4*(2 + \\sqrt{5})} = 2\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}$.\n\nRound 5:\nThus, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (2 + \\sqrt{5},2\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{5}})$. \nThe distance (length) AB can now be calculated using the distance formula: \n\n$AB = \\sqrt{(2 + \\sqrt{5} - 0)^2 + (2\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{5}} - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 + \\sqrt{5})^2 + 4(2 + \\sqrt{5})} = \\sqrt{4 + 4\\sqrt{5} + 5 + 8 + 4\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{17+8\\sqrt{5}}= \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}.$", "round 2": "The correct formulation is as follows:\n\nRound 1: \nThe equation of a tangent to a parabola with the form $y^2 = 4ax$ is given by $yy_1=2ax(x+x_1)$ where $(x_1,y_1)$ is an arbitrary point that lies on the parabola. Since the tangent is drawn from the point $(1,3)$, which is not on the parabola, we need to express these lines in the general form of $y = mx+c$.\n\nBut we won't dwell on this step long, because finding the exact equations isn't necessary for this problem. Instead, we only need to recognize that any line from $(1,3)$ which is tangent to the parabola will intersect the parabola at a point with an $x$-value larger than 1 (because the parabola opens rightward). \n\nRound 2:\nThe points where the tangents touch the parabola, A and B, can have their coordinates stated in the parametric form $(at^2,2at)$ (since $y^2 = 4ax$ is equivalent to $y = 2at, x = at^2$). Thus, the equations of the tangents from $(1,3)$ can be written as $y = mx + c$, which is equivalent to $t = (y - 1)/(x - 3)$.\n\nRound 3:\nSubstituting $y = 2at$ into the above gives $t = (2at - 1)/(at^2 - 3)$, a quadratic equation in $t$, the roots of which will give the slopes of the tangents. Setting this equal to zero gives $2at^3 - 3t^2 - 2at + 1 = 0$. As we are dealing with two tangents from the same point, the quadratic should have real equal roots, which happens when the discriminant is zero. Thus we solve $(-3)^2 - 4*(2a)*(1) = 0$ for $a$. It results in $a = 9/8$.\n\nRound 4:\nThe initial equation of the parabola was $y^2 = 4x$. For $4x$ to be equivalent to $4ax$, $a$ must be $1$.\n\nRound 5:\nThis doesn't match with the $a$ we found in the last step, so let's go back and reassess our steps. In Round 2, the equivalence we used to get the quadratic in $t$ was really $t = \\frac{m}{2}$ (and not $t = \\frac{m + c}{2}$ as we previously assumed)\nThis is because the parameter $t$ is really the slope of the tangent line divided by 2 (as shown by the equivalent form $y = 2at, x = at^2$). \n\nRound 6:\nKnowing that, we can rewrite our quadratic in terms of $m$ as $(2am)^3 - 3m^2 - 2am + 1 = 0$. Expand and simplify to $8a^3m^3 - 6m^2 - 8am + 1 = 0$.  And now, since we know $a = 1$, this simplifies to $8m^3 - 6m^2 - 8m + 1 = 0$.\n\nRound 7:\nThis cubic equation has three roots (which we know from the fundamental theorem of algebra). The roots can be obtained by the rational root theorem or by using a calculator. Doing so, we find the roots $m = -1/2$, $m = 1/2(2 - \\sqrt{5})$, and $m = 1/2(2 + \\sqrt{5})$. Disregarding the negative root (since it doesn't result in $x > 1$), we are left with our final slopes.\n\nRound 8:\nKnowing these slopes, we can write the equation of the tangent lines as $y - 3 = m(x - 1)$, and substituting $y = 2at$ results in $2at - 3 = m(at^2 - 1)$. This implies that $m = (2at - 3)/(at^2 - 1)$.\n\nRound 9:\nSubstituting the two positive roots of $m$ into this equation gives the $t$ values that correspond to these slopes. For $m = 1/2(2 - \\sqrt{5})$, we get $t = (2 - \\sqrt{5})$. For $m = 1/2(2 + \\sqrt{5})$, we get $t = (2 + \\sqrt{5})$. These are the $t$ values that correspond to the points A and B.\n\nRound 10:\nWe finally find the coordinates of A and B as $(at^2,2at)$ for these $t$ values. For A, with $t = 2 - \\sqrt{5}$, we get $A = ((2 - \\sqrt{5})^2, 2*(2 - \\sqrt{5}))$. And for B, with $t = 2 + \\sqrt{5}$, we get $B = ((2 + \\sqrt{5})^2, 2*(2 + \\sqrt{5}))$.\n\nRound 11:\nWith the coordinates of A and B, we can calculate the length $AB$ as the absolute difference of their $y$-coordinates, since the line formed by them is parallel to the y-axis. So, $AB = 2*(2 + \\sqrt{5})- 2*(2 - \\sqrt{5})$.\n\nRound 12:\nThis simplifies to $8\\sqrt{5}$, the length of line segment AB. Therefore, the length of the line segment from A to B is $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{5}}$.\n\nAll the previous agents have provided valuable information but seem to have made calculation or concept errors in various areas. But, by building upon and correcting these parts, we are able to reach the right solution."}]}
