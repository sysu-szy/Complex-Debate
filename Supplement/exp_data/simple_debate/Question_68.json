Therefore:\n\n$\\dfrac{x^4 + 1}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{x^4 \\cdot 1}$, giving that $\\dfrac{x^4 + 1}{2} \\geq x^2$\n\nLikewise, $\\dfrac{y^4 + 1}{2} \\geq y^2$ and $\\dfrac{z^4 + 1}{2} \\geq z^2$\n\nThen, I multiply these three inequalities together giving \n\n$\\dfrac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{8} \\geq x^2 y^2 z^2$\n\nFrom here, I simplify this inequality to $\\dfrac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z} \\geq 8z$.\n\nNext, by the AM-GM inequality I know that $\\dfrac{x+y+z}{3} \\geq (xyz)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, and as $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive real numbers, I can simplify this inequality to $\\dfrac{x + y + z}{3} \\geq z$.\n\nFrom these two inequalities, I can further derive that $\\dfrac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z} \\geq 24$. \n\nTo find the minimum value, I need to solve the equations $\\dfrac{x^4 + 1}{2} = x^2$, $\\dfrac{y^4 + 1}{2} = y^2$, and $\\dfrac{z^4 + 1}{2} = z^2$. From which, I get $x=y=1$ and $z=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinally, substituting these values back to the original equation, I prove that $\\dfrac{(x^4 + 1)(y^4 + 1)(z^4 + 1)}{xy^2 z} = 24$, which is the minimum value achieved. Therefore, the answer should be $a+b+c = 24 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{26}$."}]}
