We can denote the number of games she won by W and the total number of games she played by T. Therefore, W = 0.5T or W = T/2.

Let's substitute this into our inequality:\n\n(T/2 + 3) / (T + 4) > 0.503\n\nIf we multiply everything by 2 to clear the fraction, we get\n\n(T + 6) / (2T + 8) > 0.503\n\nLet's now cross-multiply:\n\n0.503(2T + 8) < (T + 6)\n\nSolving this yields us 1.006T + 4.024 < T + 6\n\nSubtract 1.006T from both sides gives us -0.006T + 4.024 < 6\n\nSubtract 4.024 from both sides, we get -0.006T < 1.976\n\nAs the coefficient of T is negative and we want to isolate T, divide across by -0.006. Remember that dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number will reverse the inequality sign.\n\nTherefore, T > 1.976/-0.006\n\nThis gives us T > -329.33.\n\nHowever, T must be a positive integer as it represents the total number of games played. So the largest possible value for T is 1.\n\nSubstitute T = 1 into our initial equation (W = T/2) to solve for W. This gives us W = 0.5.

Their solution might seem to contradict that of others because they correctly noted that the win ratio could only increase to above 0.503 with the addition of more wins, which means the tennis player didn't win any matches before the weekend.
