The function doubles any input $x$ in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$ and subtracts twice the value of $x$ from $2$ if the $x$ is within the interval $(\\frac{1}{2},1]$.

We have discovered that, the number of intervals doubles with each iteration of $f$, so there would be $2^{2005}$ equal intervals in total.

According to this function, smaller numbers are doubled every subsequent function application, which causes sharp ramp-up towards 1. For numbers greater than half, it abruptly falls down to values near 0 after each subsequent function. Thus, after 2 iterations of the function, all numbers end up somewhere in [0,1]. Therefore, Agent 3's claim of a 2-cycle mapping under the function $f$ doesn't seem to hold. \n\nComing back to the problem, we notice that $f^{[2n]}(x)$ denotes the value at the end of 2n function iterations starting from x.

Therefore, partitions ending above 1/4 and below 1/2 and partitions ending above 3/4 contribute to the count of such x.\n\nThere's a pattern in this recursive function where each partition at n-th application produces 2 partitions at (n+1)-th application.

This means there are exactly two preimages of $\\frac{1}{4}$ and two preimages of $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nRound 5:\nSo, the total number of solutions for $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$ is $2^2 = 4$. \n\nGiven $4 = 2^2$, we find that $p=2$ and $a=2$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{4}.", "round 1": "I agree with the solution provided by Agent 0 for this problem. Let's break down the reason behind this.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ applies operations on $x$ by doubling when $x$ is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$, and subtracting twice the value of $x$ from $2$ when $x$ is greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$. And $[0, 1]$ is continuously mapped to itself under these operations.\n\nOne important point to note is that for each $x$ following the application of the function $f$, $x$ lands in exactly one of four intervals: $[0, \\frac{1}{4}]$, $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}]$, or $(\\frac{3}{4},1]$.\n\nThe solutions to $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ were found to be at $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$, and before application of function $f$, these solutions were in the intervals $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}]$ and  $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}]$ respectively.\n\nSo, if we apply the function $f$ $2005$ times on $x$ (i.e., $f^{[2005]}(x)$), the number of possible intervals $x$ would land in would be $2^{4010}$ since each application of function $f$ divides the previous set of intervals into 4 equal parts. \n\nThis turns into a counting problem of how many of these $2^{4010}$ intervals will contain our solutions of $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$. \n\nThe solutions are shown to be $4^{2004} \\times 2 = 2^{4016}$. So, the number of solutions is of the form $2^{4016}$, making $p = 2$ and $a = 4016$. \n\nTherefore, using the provided instruction to find $p + a$, the answer is $2 + 4016 = \\boxed{4018}$. I am pretty confident this is a correct and simplified final answer.", "round 2": "The main goal of this problem is finding the number of values of $x$ such that after the application of the function $f$ for 2005 iterations, we reach the value of $\\frac{1}{2}$. A valuable observation from Agent 0 is that these values occur when $x$ is either $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe application of the function $f$ maps $x$ into one of four intervals: $[0, \\frac{1}{4}]$, $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}]$, or $(\\frac{3}{4},1]$. This process continues recursively, doubling the number of intervals with each iteration. Thus, after $n$ iterations, we have $2^n$ equal intervals in the range $[0,1]$.\n\nFor $n = 2005$, there will be $2^{2005}$ equal intervals. Since only the ones involving $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$ contribute to us reaching a final value of $\\frac{1}{2}$, the task ultimately develops into counting those particular intervals.\n\nFor evenly distributed intervals, each of $0, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}$, and $1$ will be hit $2^{2004}$ times, therefore the intervals including $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$ amount to $(2^{2004})^2 = 2^{4016}$.\n\nJoining this information and expressing the total number of solutions in the form $p^a$, we find $p = 2$ and $a = 4016$. This leads to a final answer of $p + a = 2 + 4016 = \\boxed{4018}$. \n\nThe most consistent and accurate solutions came from Agent 0 and Agent 3, but Agent 0's explanation, while more succinct, didn't provide as much explanation behind the reasoning as Agent 3's did. However, the soundness of this result can be confirmed by the consensus from these and other opinions. The other agents made reasonable but flawed arguments that helped highlight how careful and precise one must be in dissecting such a complex problem."}]}
