{"question": "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?\n\nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.", "answer": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \nWe can consider the arrival of the cars one by one.

Agent solution0, Agent solution2 and Agent solution3 are correct.

In this case, every car that comes to the light has three choices of lanes, thus the total number of ways the six cars can stack up is equal to 3^6, which is indeed 729.

This again gives us 3 possibilities.\n\nRound 3: \nSimilarly, the third car also has 3 options, no matter where the first two cars have chosen to pullover. This gives us 3 possibilities.\n\nThis process repeats for the remaining three cars:\n\nRounds 4, 5, and 6: \nAll three cars follow the same pattern, each having three lanes to choose from and each adding 3 possibilities. \n\nTherefore, given each of the six cars has three choices, the total number of possibilities can be calculated as 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6. \n\nSo, there are \\boxed{729} different ways the six cars can position themselves at the red light."}]}
