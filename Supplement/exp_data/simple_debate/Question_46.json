Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.\n\nNext, we consider $|x+1| \\le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \\le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.\n\nThe only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\\boxed{-15}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\nTo begin, we isolate the absolute value symbol in both inequalities.\n\nIn the first equation we have,\n|x| + 1 > 7\nSubtract 1 on both sides, giving,\n|x| > 6.\nThis inequality translates to two additional inequalities: x > 6 and x < -6.\n\nFor the second equation we have,\n|x + 1| \u2264 7\nThis inequality translates to two additional inequalities: x + 1 \u2264 7 and x + 1 \u2265 -7.\nSolving these two, we find -7 \u2264 x \u2264 6.\n\nRound 2:\nAnalyzing the inequalities, any value for x that satisfies both the inequalities given in the question will lie in the intersection of the solution ranges of these inequalities.
