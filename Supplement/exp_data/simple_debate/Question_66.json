In particular, the function may or may not be zero at some points. Thus, let's start by setting $f(0)$ to different potential values (like $0$, $1$, etc.) and see what happens.\n\nIf $f(0)=0$, then by setting $y=x$ we get $0=f(0)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So the function is zero everywhere, including at the point  $2017$, i.e., $f(2017)=0$.\n\nIf $f(0)=1$, setting $y=x$ we get $1=f(0)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So the function is constant everywhere. But if $f(0)$ is constant and non-zero, then setting $y=0$ in the original equation we get $f(x)=1$ for all $x$. Hence, the function must be identically $1$. But then, setting $x \\neq 0$, $y=x$ we get $1=f(0)$, which is a contradiction because $f(0)=1$.\n\nSo far we conclude $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, including at the point 2017. \n\nNext, if $f(0)=c$ for some non-zero real number $c$, then setting $y=x$ we get $c=f(0)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so the function is constant. But then, setting $y=0$ in the equation we get $f(x)=c$, contradicting our assumption that $c$ is non-zero.\n\nAt the end of this first round, we have determined that the only possible value for $f(2017)$ is $0$, assuming $f$ is constant.\n\nRound 2:\nNext, we investigate the case when $f$ is not constant. To handle this case, we set $x=y$ in the given equation to get $f(x)^2=f(0)$, which implies $f(x)=\\sqrt{f(0)}$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nNow, if $f(0)>0$ then $f(x)=\\sqrt{f(0)}$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, contradicting our assumption that $f$ is not constant.

Careful step by step analysis of these interpretations lead to the following conclusions.\n\nIf $f(0)=0$, taking $x=y$ in the equation gives $f(x)^2 = f(0)$, which leads to all points of the function, including $f(2017)$, being equal to $0$.\n\nFor the case when $f(0)=1$, things get a bit more muddled. Agent 1 and agent 3 correctly argue that we can use the equation to get $f(x)^2 = f(0)$, which leads to $f(x) = \\pm 1$ for all x.

As we have assumed that $f(0)=0$, this leads to the conclusion that $f(x)^2 = 0$ and therefore $f(x) = 0$. Hence, our function becomes the zero function, which means that $f(2017) = 0$. All agents agreed on this conclusion. \n\nIf we consider the second scenario where $f(0)=1$, we can do a similar substitution of $y=x$ into the function to get $f(x)^2 = f(x - x)$ which simplifies to $f(x)^2 = f(0)$.

Hence $f(x) = 1$ or $f(x) = -1$ for all $x$ since the square root of 1 is either 1 or -1. This is the point where the two agents diverge in argument.\n\nAgent 0 concluded that the function cannot be constantly $-1$ since then the equation would yield $1 =-1$, which is a contradiction. But he didn\u2019t consider that the function could be equal to $1$ at some points and $-1$ at other points.\n\nOn the other hand, Agent 3 considered whether the function could be equal to $1$ or $-1$ at different points. By assuming that there exist $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a) = 1$ and $f(b) = -1$, Agent 3 corroborates the argument by positing that from equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x-y)$ we would get $f(a)f(b) = f(a-b)$, or equivalently $-1 = 1$ or $-1 = -1$. This follows since $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ can only be $1$ or $-1$ we get a contradictory case when $f(a-b) = 1$. So $f(a)$ must be equal to $f(b)$ for all $a$ and $b$. Hence, the function is constant. And since it's constant and we know it's either $1$ or $-1$ we check the possible values and conclude that the function can only be constantly $1$.\n\nThus, in conclusion, the function must be either the constant function 0 or the constant function 1. The case of $f(0) = 0$ gives the constant function 0 and the case of $f(0) = 1$ gives the constant function 1.

This solution indeed satisfies the functional equation so $f(2017)=0$ in this case.\n\nThe discrepancy arises when $f(0) = 1$, because the functional equation $f(x)f(y)=f(x-y)$ now becomes $f(x)f(y)=f(x-y)$ for all $x$, $y$. Though it's clear that $f(x)=1$ for all $x$ does satisfy this, agents diverge on whether or not $f(x) = -1$ for all $x$ is also a valid solution or not.\n\nAs reasoned by Agent 0 and Agent 2, substituting $f(x) = -1$ into the functional equation does yield a valid result: $(-1)*(-1) = -1 - (-1)$.\n\nSo, while it is perhaps less intuitive, it is clear that $f(x) = -1$ is indeed a valid solution when $f(0) = 1$ according to the functional equation.

This is obviously a solution, so let's assume $f(0) = 1$ and find other possible solutions.\n\nRound 2: Further Observations\n\nAssuming $f(0) = 1$, if we take $y = 0$ in the given equation, we discover that $f(x)f(0) = f(x)$, which simplifies to $f(x) = f(x)$. This does not lead to a contradiction, hence it confirms our assumption that $f(0) = 1$. It's worth noting that under this condition, the function $f$ is clearly nonzero, since if there exists some $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$, substituting $x = x_0$ and $y = x_0$ into the functional equation yields $0 = 1$. \n\nRound 3: Unearthing the function\n\nNext, let's take $y = -x$ and see what happens. We get that $f(x)f(-x) = f(2x)$ or equivalently, $f(-x) = f(2x)/f(x)$. This gives us that $f$ is an even function, thus $f(-x) = f(x)$.\nWe can do more. If we let $x = y = a$ in the given equation, we obtain $f(2a) = f(a)^2$.\n\nRound 4: Cornering the function\n\nTo find a method to identify the function, note that for any rational number $q = p/q$, we can write $f(q) = f\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{q}\\right)^p$.  \nHence, the function $f$ is fully determined by its values at the reciprocals of natural numbers.\nBy the equation $f(2a) = f(a)^2$, we can thus determine the function $f$ completely for rational numbers, and extend it continuously to the real numbers.\nTherefore, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, $f(x) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{ax}$ for some natural number a.\n\nRound 5: The Final Evaluation\n\nBy the functional equation, each possible value of $f(2017)$ results in a potentially different solution for $f$.
