When you choose 5 players out of the total 10 for the first team, the remaining 5 automatically form the second team. \n\nRound 2:\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nRound 3:\nPlugging in the values given in the problem, we need to compute C(10, 5) which equals to 10! / (5!(10-5)!).\n\nRound 4:\nWe know that 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5!, and both 5! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. As such, we're left with 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1), which simplifies to 252.\n\nTherefore, the basketball team can be divided into two equivalent teams of 5 players in \\boxed{252} ways.", "round 1": "First, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe have 10 players and we want to split them into two groups of 5, to play against each other. As such, the order in which we select the groups doesn't matter: once we know which players are in the first group, we automatically know who is in the second group. Consequently, this problem is about combinations, not permutations.\n\nTo determine the number of combinations of size k from a set of size n, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n! refers to the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to n.\n\nApplying this formula to our problem, we are choosing 5 players (k=5) from a total of 10 players (n=10), so we want to calculate C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!). \n\nFor a more intuitive understanding, the numerator of our calculation 10! is equal to 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 and the denominator is 5!*5!, or (5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1). There are common factors in the numerator and the denominator that we can simplify. If we simplify, we get (10*9*8*7*6)/(5*4*3*2*1) = 252.\n\nHowever, we have taken into account the order of selection of teams. For example, if we select team 1 first and then team 2, we consider this as a different scenario from selecting team 2 first and then team 1. But in reality, this is the same division of players. Hence we have overcounted the scenarios 2 times. To address this, we must divide our result by 2, because for each selection we have made, there is a corresponding one where we would have made the exact same division of teams, but in a different order.\n\nSo our final count of distinct ways to divide the 10 players into 2 teams of 5 is 252 / 2 = 126.\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{126} different ways to divide 10 players into 2 teams of 5.", "round 2": "Given the problem, we are tasked to find the number of ways we can split 10 basketball players into two teams of 5 each without distinguishing the teams i.e, the order in which we select the teams does not matter. Therefore, this problem is a combinations problem. \n\nStep 1: Combinations Calculation\nWe can represent this as a combination problem using the formula C(n, k) = n! / ((n-k)! * k!), where n is the number of players and k is the number of players on a team. In our case, we are choosing 5 players from a group of 10, so the formula becomes C(10, 5) = 10! / ((10-5)! * 5!).\n\nStep 2: Calculation of Factorials\nTo solve this, we calculate the factorials. For 10!, we would multiply all positive integers from 1 to 10, but we can simplify computation by cancelling out the common elements between the numerator and denominator. Therefore the calculation simplifies to (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252.\n\nStep 3: Adjustment for Over-counting\nHowever, since order of selecting the teams doesn\u2019t matter, each team selection has been accounted for twice (one for each team).
