The opposite corners of a rectangle are equal in distance. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we obtain the distance formula $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ which helps us compute the distance between $A$ and $O$, and $C$ and $B$. By doing so, we equate these two distances to express $B$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. \n\nRound 2:\nComputing the distances, we get $\\sqrt{b^2 + (b^2)^2}$ for $A$ and $O$, and $\\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + (a^2-(a^2+b^2))^2}$ for $C$ and $B$.

Since $OABC$ is a rectangle, its $OA$ and $OC$ sides are the same length, and they are perpendicular to the sides $AB$ and $BC$. For $OC$ to meet the parabola at a point $C$, it must be a vertical line that is equal in length to $OA$ and similarly at distance from the origin $O$. Hence, let's state $OC$ as a vertical line $x = a$ where $a$ is distance $OA$ from the origin.\n\nRound 2: The Calculation of Length and Angle from the Origin to the Parabola's Vertex\n\nSince the parabola $y=x^2$ is symmetric across the $y$-axis, the origin $O$ and the point $C(a, a^2)$ are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. For us to get the coordinates of $B$, we need to calculate the length of $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ and the angle from $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ to the $x$-axis. The vector $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ can be written as $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a^2 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the length of $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^4}$.\n\nThe angle of $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ from the positive $x$-axis can be calculated as $tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{a^2}{a}\\right)$; since $0 \\leq a$, $0 \\leq \\frac{a^2}{a} = a$, so the angle is $tan^{-1}(a)$.\n\nRound 3: The Statement of the Parabola's Vertex Coordinates Function\n\nIn order to find the coordinates of $B$, we rotate the vector $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ 90 degrees counterclockwise. The formula for rotating a vector $\\overrightarrow{v}$ by an angle of $\\theta$ counterclockwise to generate a vector $\\overrightarrow{w}$ is $\\overrightarrow{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\\overrightarrow{v}$.\n\nBecause we have to rotate a vector $\\overrightarrow{OC}$, the transformation matrix changes to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(90^{\\circ} + tan^{-1}(a)) & -\\sin(90^{\\circ} + tan^{-1}(a)) \\\\ \\sin(90^{\\circ} + tan^{-1}(a)) & \\cos(90^{\\circ} + tan^{-1}(a)) \\end{pmatrix}$ = $\\begin{pmatrix} -tan(a) & -1 \\\\ 1 & -tan(a) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe vector $\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{pmatrix} -tan(a) & -1 \\\\ 1 & -tan(a) \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ = $\\begin{pmatrix} -a^{3}  - a \\\\ a  - a^{3} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTherefore, $B$ will always lie on the parabola defined by this vector.\n\nRound 4: The Derivation of the Parabola Equation on which the Vertex lies\n\nThe vertical and horizontal coordinates of $B(x, y)$ are $-a^{3}  - a$ and $a  - a^{3}$ respectively. To eliminate $a$, square both and add them to get the equation of the new parabola. This gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 2a^4 + 2a^2 = 2(a^2+1)$. Since $x = -a^{3}  - a$ or $a^{3}  + a +x=0$ has $a=0$ as a root, you can factor the left side to get $a(a+y)(a-y)=0$. Therefore, $a^2 = y^2$, so $y^2 + 2(a^2+1) = y^2 + 2(y^2+1) = 2y^2+2 = 2(y^2 + 1)$.\n\nSo, a point $(x, y)$ lies on the parabola defined by the vertex $B$ if and only if $x^{2} + y^{2} = 2(y^{2} + 1)$, which simplifies to $x^2 = 2-2y^2$ or $y^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Any parabola in standard form is given by $y = px^2+qx+r$; therefore, we can rewrite our equation as $y^2 =  - \\frac{1}{2}x^2+1$, and by taking the square root we find $y = \\pm \\sqrt{- \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 1}$.\n\nTaking the positive square root (since $y \\geq 0$ for the parabola to be above the $x$-axis), we get $y = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}$. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the parabola defined by vertex B is \\boxed{y = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}}.", "round 1": "Analyzing each solution provided, it is clear that some critical steps were misunderstood or misplaced across most agents.
