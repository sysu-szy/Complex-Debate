The number $6$ is the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $11$, because $2*6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n\nRound 2: \nNext, we need to use Hensel's lifting lemma to find the inverse modulo $11^2=121$. According to Hensel's Lemma, a root $r_1$ of $f$ modulo $p^n$ can be lifted to a root $r_2$ of $f$ modulo $p^{n+1}$, where $r_2$ is in the form $r_1+k*p^n$ and $k$ is an integer that solves the equation $f'(r_1+k*p^n)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIn our case, $f(x)=24x-1$, $p=11$, $n=1$, and $r_1=6$.
