The equation for the tangent to the parabola from the external point $(p,q)$ is given by $yy_1 = 2a(x+x_1)$ where $y_1=q+/- \\sqrt{2aQ}$ and $x_1=p-\\dfrac{Q}{2a}=p-a^2$ where $Q=2aq-p^2$. This equation was correctly derived and solved by the agents, providing two slopes $m$ and corresponding coordinate sets for $A$ and $B$ correctly:\n\n$A=\\left(\\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\sqrt{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\right)$\n\n$B=\\left(\\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\sqrt{7-3\\sqrt{5}}\\right)$\n\nThe point of contention now is how to calculate the distance between these points. The correct way to do this is to use the distance formula:\n$$AB=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}.$$ \n\nSubstituting the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ into this equation gives us\n$$AB=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} - \\frac{7 + 3\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\sqrt{7-3\\sqrt{5}} -  \\sqrt{7+3\\sqrt{5}}\\right)^2},$$ \n\nwhich simplifies to\n$$AB = \\sqrt{(2)(3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (2 \\sqrt{3\\sqrt{5}})^2} = \\sqrt{180 + 60},$$ \n\nso indeed $AB=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThus, all agents were correct except for Agent solution3, who calculated the final distance incorrectly. The consensus is that the length of $AB$ is $5\\sqrt{3}$."}]}
