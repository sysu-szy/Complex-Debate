To maximize revenue, we first need to understand the relationship between the price of the smartphones and the number of smartphones sold. The problem tells us that if the price of a smartphone decreases by $5, then the shop will sell 10 more smartphones. Now let's introduce a variable to represent the decrease in the price of the smartphones, say \"x\". \"x\" here denotes the number of increments of $5 decreases in price. Accordingly, for each \"x\", 10 more smartphones will be sold.\n\nRound 2: \nNow that we understand the relationship, let's begin solving the algebra problem. The total revenue generated by selling the smartphones is the price of each smartphone multiplied by the number of smartphones sold. Since the original price is $450 and the price decreases by $5 for every increment in x, the price can be represented mathematically as $(450-5x)$. The number of phones sold starts at 500 and increases by 10 for every increment of x, so the number sold can be represented as $(500+10x)$. Therefore, the total revenue (R), can be represented as a function of \"x\", R(x) = (450 - 5x) * (500 + 10x).\n\nRound 3:\nSimplify the revenue function. We can do this by multiplying out the brackets:\nR(x) = 450*500 + 450*10x - 5x*500 - 5x*10x \n= 225000 + 4500x -2500x - 50x^2\nRearranging the terms from highest to lowest power of x gives us the quadratic equation:\nR(x) = -50x^2 + 2000x + 225000\n\nRound 4:\nWe know that a quadratic function reaches its maximum value at the vertex of the parabola. And the x-coordinate of this vertex can be found using the formula -b/2a for a quadratic equation, ax^2 + bx + c. In our equation a = -50, b = 2000. Plugging these into the formula, we get:\nx = -2000/(2*(-50)) = 20\n\nPutting it all together:\nFinally, recall that \"x\" was the number of $5 decreases in price. So if \"x\" is 20, then the price has decreased 20*$5 = $100. The original price was $450, so the price that would maximize revenue is $450-$100 = $350. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{350}.", "round 1": "Given that revenue R is calculated by the price p times the quantity q of smartphones sold, we have:\n\nR = p*q\n\nThe initial situation is:\np1 = $450\nq1 = 500\n\nFrom the given information, for each $5 decrease in price, the number of smartphones sold increases by 10. So for n amount of $5 decreases in price, we have:\n\np = p1 - 5n\nq = q1 + 10n\n\nWhich translates to:\n\np = $450 - $5n\nq = 500 + 10n\n\nSubstituting these values into our revenue equation, we get:\n\nR(n) = p*q = ($450 - $5n)*(500 + 10n)\n\nWhen we simplify this, we get:\n\nR(n) = 225000 -100n - 50n^2\n\nThe maximum revenue is obtained at the maximum point of this parabola. For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = y, this maximum point is at x = -b/2a. Here, a=-50 and b=-100. So,\n\nn_max = -(-100) / (2*(-50)) = 20\n\nHowever, n is the number of $5 decreases from the initial price.
