To find $q$, we notice that since the x coordinates of A and B differ by 2t and the y coordinates of A and B differ by 2t^2 (since AB is a side of the rectangle), the slope of AB is $2t$.\n\nThe slope of AB can also be found by differentiating $y=px^2+qx+r$ to get $y'=2px+q$ and substitinating the x-coordinate of B, which gives $y'(-t)=-2t+q$. Setting the two expressions of the slope equal gives $-2t+q=2t$ which simplifies to $q=4t$.

That means the line AB has to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis too. That's only possible if AB is a horizontal line which implies that the slope of AB has to be 0.

Notice that these points share the same y-coordinate because they are on the same horizontal level.\n\nNow, look at point B. Since OABC is a rectangle, the height OB has to be the same as the height OA, which is a\u00b2. Because AB is horizontal being aligned vertically with the y-axis, the x-coordinate of B is the same as that of C, which is -a.\n\nTherefore, point B = (-a, a\u00b2).\n\nHowever, we want the coordinates of B expressed in terms of y.

The fact that A and C have coordinates as (a, a^2) and (-a, a^2) reveals they follow the same y-values on the given parabola. This leads to the conclusion that a must be equal to x (since x can be either positive or negative, representing A or C).\n\nThus, upon substituting a = x in B = (0, a\u00b2), we get B = (0, x\u00b2).

As given, $OA$ and $OC$ touch the parabola at $A$ and $C$ and therefore their equations will be $y = x^2$, so we can write these as $A = (x_1, x_1^2)$ and $C = (x_2, x_2^2)$.\n\nFurthermore, we know that the coordinates of the origin $O$ are $(0,0)$ so we can say that $OA = OC = x_2 - x_1$ (since the rectangle has the same vertical and horizontal lengths).\n\nNow, consider point $B$, which is the fourth vertex of the rectangle. $B$ must lie somewhere on a line that is parallel to $AC$ and passes through $O$. In other words, the slope of the line containing $B$ must be equal to the slope of $AC$. \n\nThe slope of $AC$ is given by\n$m = \\frac{C_y - A_y}{C_x - A_x} = \\frac{x_2^2 - x_1^2}{x_2 - x_1})\n= \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = x_2 + x_1$.\n\nAs $B$ is also a distance of $x_2 - x_1$ away from the origin along this line, we can find its $y$ coordinate by multiplying the slope $m$ by the $x$ coordinate, yielding\n$B_y = m(x_2 - x_1) = (x_2 + x_1)(x_2 - x_1) = x_2^2 - x_1^2$.\n\nIt's clear now that the $y$ coordinate of point $B$ will always lie on a function of the form $y = px^2 - qx^2$ for some constants $p$ and $q$ since the $y$ coordinate of $B$ is directly proportional to $x^2 - x_1^2$.

The disagreement appears to revolve around what the exact parabola is.\n\nFirst we note that A = (a, a^2) and C = (-a, a^2). This is common to all the solutions and represents the key observation for the question. Additionally, since OABC is a rectangle, then OC is perpendicular to OA and is also the same length. This means OC = (-2a,0), and by simple vector addition we can determine B as the result of OC from point A, which gives B = (0,2a^2).\n\nThis agrees with Agent 0, Agent 2 and Agent 3.

To do so we need to express B's y-coordinate as a function of x. Given that points A and C lie on the parabola y = x^2, we have A = (a, a^2) and C = (-a, a^2), and since A and C represent the same y-values on the parabola, it must be true that a = |x|.\n\nSubstituting a = |x| into B = (0,2a^2) we get B = (0,2|x|^2) which we can write as y = 2x^2 since |x|^2 = x^2.\n\nHence, the parabola B lies on is defined by the equation $y = 2x^2$, agreeing with the conclusions of Agent 0, Agent 2 and Agent 3.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{y=2x^2}.", "round 2": "Examining the solutions provided by the agents, it is clear that there is a disagreement about the equation of the parabola where point B lies.

The square form is used because they lie on a parabola, which demands a second degree equation, and the symmetry about y-axis is represented by a and -a respectively. \n\nSince OABC is a rectangle, and we know that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, we know that OB is of the same length as OA, hence the y-coordinate of B has to be a\u00b2, and the length of OC is the same length as OA, which is 2a. Then, since OC is a horizontal line along the x-axis, the x-coordinate of B must be the same as that of C, which is -a.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of B will be (-a,a\u00b2).\n\nRewriting the coordinates of B in terms of y yields (-\u221ay, y) using the square root because the original form was a square (a\u00b2) in the y-coordinate.\n\nBut if we note, the x-coordinate of B (-\u221ay) will always be equal to zero as it lies on the y-axis since it forms a rectangle with OC lying on x-axis and hence, bisecting it.\n\nTherefore, we can ignore the x-coordinate and write the point B as (0, y). \n\nThe equation y = x\u00b2 is satisfied by point B, although B actually traces the line x = 0 as the rectangle OABC varies. The parabolic locus y = x\u00b2 is really a degenerate case because B turns out to be always on the y-axis no matter where A and C are chosen on the parabola y = x\u00b2 to form the rectangle OABC.\n\nTo conclude: Using the given coordinates and the properties of the square, it's deduced that point B lies on the line x = 0, or for the purpose of the question, the degenerate parabola \\boxed{y=x^2}.
