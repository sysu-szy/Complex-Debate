We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative.

In this problem, we know the function for how many books will be sold (x): x = 120 - 3p. We can substitute this function into the formula for R to create a function that represents the revenue: R = p(120 - 3p).\n\nRound 2: Solve the Problem\n\nTo maximize the store's revenue, we need to find the maximum value of the function for R, which occurs at the function's vertex in this case as the function is a downward facing parabola (since the coefficient of p^2 is negative). A parabolic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is maximized or minimized at x = -b/(2a). We can rewrite R = p(120 - 3p) = -3p^2 + 120p. So, in this case, a = -3, and b = 120. Plugging these values into the formula gives p = -120/(2*(-3)).\n\nRound 3: Simplify the Answer\n\nSimplifying -120/(2*(-3)) gives $p = \\boxed{20}$.\n\nTherefore, the bookstore should charge $20 per book to maximize revenue.", "round 1": "Understanding the Problem:\n\nThe bookstore wishes to maximize its revenue.

To find the maximum revenue, we need to find the vertex of the parabola as this function is pointing downwards (the coefficient of p^2 is negative).\n\nThe quadratic equation is normally in the form of f(x)=ax^2+bx+c. For maximizing the revenue, we rewrite our revenue function as: R = -3p^2 + 120p.\n\nComputing the Solution:\n\nThe price, p, at which the revenue will be maximized can be obtained from the formula of the vertex of the parabola which is -b/(2a). In our equation, a = -3 and b = 120. Plugging these values into the formula gives p = -120 / (2*(-3)), which simplifies to $p = \\boxed{20}$.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the profit, the bookstore should charge $20 for each book.

The maximum price (p) should not exceed $40.\n\nStep 2: Formulating the problem:\n\nThe equation R = p * (120 - 3p) can be expanded to R = 120p - 3p^2, which is a quadratic function. And we know the quadratic function reaches its maximum value at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nStep 3: Calculation:\n\nFrom the quadratic function, the x-coordinate of the vertex (which corresponds to the price p that maximise the revenue) can be found with the formula -b/(2a), where b is the coefficient of the p term and a is the coefficient of the p^2 term. In our formula, a = -3 and b = 120. So substituting these values in the formula, we get p = -120 / (2*(-3)) which simplifies to $p = 20$.\n\nStep 4: Verification:\n\nWe have to ensure that the second derivative of the revenue function is negative to confirm that p = 20 is a maximum point. The first derivative of the function R = -3p^2 + 120p is R' = -6p + 120, and the second derivative is -6, which is less than zero.

To maximize the revenue, we have to find the price at which the derivative of the revenue with respect to the price is zero.
