This means we can use the Pythagorean theorem: in right-angled triangle $EDF$, $ED^2 = DE^2 + EM^2$. Note that $DE=4$ is the length of the vertical or horizontal sides in the figure.\n\nAlso, looking at the entire figure, we can see that triangle $CDF$ is also right-angled at $D$.

Thus, triangle $DEF$ is an isosceles right triangle at angle $D$.\n\nIn an isosceles right triangle, the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse from the vertex of the right angle bisects the hypotenuse into two equal halves.\n\nSo, in triangle $DEF$, $M$ is the midpoint of $DF$, making the lengths of $DM$ and $MF$ equal to each other.
