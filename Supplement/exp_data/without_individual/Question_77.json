Let's solve it using calculus. First, it's important to rewrite the equation of the ellipse in a form that's useful for the optimization problem we're dealing with. The equation of the ellipse $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$ can be rewritten as $x^2 + (y/2)^2 = 1$ so that we can see it's an ellipse stretched vertically by a factor of 1/2. The points on this ellipse where the $y$ coordinate is maximized or minimized (i.e., the top and bottom vertices of the ellipse) are where the maximum or minimum distance to the point P will occur. \n\nRound 2: \n\nTo find these points, we'll specify a point $Q = (x, y)$ on the ellipse and then find the value of $y$ that maximizes the distance from $Q$ to $P$. The square of the distance can be represented by $d^2 = (x - (-1))^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2.$ We want to find the maximum of this function given the constraint $x^2 + (y/2)^2 = 1$.\n\nRound 3:\n\nWe can rewrite the constraint in terms of $y$ to get $y = 2\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, and substitute this into the equation for $d^2$ to get $d^2 = (x+1)^2 + 4(1 - x^2).$ Now we can maximize $d^2$ by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nRound 4:\n\nThe derivative of $d^2$ is $2(x+1) - 8x = 2 - 6x$. Setting this equal to zero and solving for x gives $x = 2/6 = 1/3$. Substituting this back into the equation for $y$ gives $y = 2\\sqrt{1 - (1/3)^2} = 2\\sqrt{8/9} = 4\\sqrt{2}/3$.\n\nRound 5:\n\nSo the point $Q$ that maximizes the distance to $P$ is $(1/3, 4\\sqrt{2}/3)$. Substituting these values into the equation for $d^2$ gives $d^2 = (1/3 + 1)^2 + (4\\sqrt{2}/3)^2 = (4/3)^2 + 32/9 = \\boxed{16/9 + 32/9 = 48/9 = 16/3}$.", "round 1": "Given that the point P is at (-1,0) and lies on the ellipse, $Q=(x,y)$ also lies on the ellipse and is represented by the equation $4x^2+y^2=4$. We can rewrite this equation as $y^2=4-4x^2$. We are looking to find the maximum distance between P and Q, represented as $d$. The distance formula gives us $d^2=(x_P - x_Q)^2 + (y_P - y_Q)^2$. Since $P=(-1,0)$ and $Q=(x,y)$, this formula simplifies to $d^2=(x+1)^2 + y^2$.\n\nWe want to maximise $d^2$, so we can substitute $y^2$ from our rewritten ellipse equation into our distance formula to remove the variable y. Doing this, we get $d^2=(x+1)^2 + 4 - 4x^2$. \n\nSimplify the equation, $d^2=5+2x - 3x^2$.\n\nFollowing steps carried out by Agent Solution0, maximise the value of $d^2$ by differentiating the function with respect to $x$ and equating it to zero to find the maximum point. The derivative of $d^2$ is $2 - 6x$. Setting the derivative equal to zero, we have $2 - 6x = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2/6$ or $x = 1/3$.\n\nSubstitute $x=1/3$ back into equation of ellipse $y^2 = 4 - 4x^2$ to get $y = 2\\sqrt{(1 - (1/3)^2)}$  which simplifies to $y = 4\\sqrt{2}/3$. This gives us the corresponding y-coordinate for the point Q that will give us the maximum length of PQ.\n\nSubstitute $x = 1/3, y = 4\\sqrt{2}/3$ back into the equation for $d^2$ gives us $d^2 = (1/3 + 1)^2 + (4\\sqrt{2}/3)^2 = (4/3)^2 + 32/9 = 16/9 + 32/9 = 48/9 = 16/3$.\n\nThus, the square of the maximum distance between P and Q is $\\boxed{16/3}$.", "round 2": "All agents start by referring to the problem, which makes it apparent PF lies on the ellipse defined by the equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$. Therefore, we can replace $4x^2$ in the equation with $4 - y^2$ thanks to the equation of our ellipse. \n\nThe agents then go along two different routes for finding the point on the ellipse that is farthest from P. Agent 0 and  Agent 2 both claim P is farthest from Q when Q is at a point along the x-axis, while Agent 1, Agent 3, and Agent 4 all believe P is farthest from Q when Q is at the top or bottom (vertical tips) of the ellipse. \n\nLooking at their computations, it becomes clear that Agent 0 and Agent 2 both made a mistake when differentiating the equation for $d^2$. The derivative of $2x$ is $2$, not $-2$, and the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$, not $-2x$. Thus, the correct equation for the derivative of $d^2$ with respect to $x$ is $2 - 6x = 0$. When you solve for $x$, you get $x = 1/3$, not $x = 1$. When you plug $x = 1/3$ back into the equation $4 - 4x^2$, you get $y^2 = 8/3$, so $y = \\sqrt{8/3}$.

The mistake involved both Agent 1 and Agent 3 inverting the major and minor axes, which led to miscalculating the farthest points and resulted in an incorrect answer.\n\nGoing by the correct interpretation of the given ellipse, we can see that Agent 2's and Agent 0's process seems right as they both didn't invert the major and minor axes and pointed out that $Q$ should be along the x-axis to maximize the distance $\\overline{PQ}$. \n\nTheir process followed the steps to maximize distance rightly with using the given ellipse equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 4.$ \n\nThe square of the distance is written as $d^2 = (x + 1)^2 + y^2.$ Substituting $y^2$ from the ellipse equation simplified it to $d^2 = 5 - 2x + x^2.$ To maximize $d^2$, its derivative with respect to x is taken, equated to 0, and solved for x, where $x = 1$ was obtained.
