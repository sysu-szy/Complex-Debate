{"question": "A textbook has 1,000 pages.  How many of the pages have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4?", "answer": "There are only a few ways to make one, two, and three digit numbers add up to $4$.  The only one-digit number whose sum is $4$ is $4$ itself.  Continuing with two-digit numbers, we note that the digits must be $4$ and $0$, $1$ and $3$, or $2$ and $2$.  This means that $13$, $22$, $31$, and $40$ are the only two-digit numbers whose digits sum to 4.  For the three-digit numbers, we organize the work in a table.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\nPossible Digits&Possible Numbers&Total Possibilities\\\\\\hline\n4,0,0&400&1\\\\\\hline\n3,1,0&103, 130, 301, 310&4\\\\\\hline\n2,2,0&202, 220&2\\\\\\hline\n2,1,1&112, 121, 211&3\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}Adding up the last column, we see that there are $10$ three-digits numbers whose digits add up to $4$.

We need to find the page numbers that sum to 4.\n\nFrom 1 to 9, only four one-digit numbers add up to 4: 4.\n\nFrom 10 to 99, two-digit numbers that add up to 4 are: 13, 22, 31, 40, 04, 14, 23, 32, 41, 104. Note that there is no repetition in this list. So there are 10 two-digit numbers where the sum of the digits equal to 4.\n\nFor three-digit numbers from 100 to 999, the hundreds-digit could only be 1 (since 2 would already cause the sum to be equal or greater than 4). Then, we can use the solution from the two-digit case by adding a '1' in front of each element, resulting in 10 valid numbers. Also, here we also assume that taking 1 for the tenth digit and finding all possible unit digits such as 103, 112, 121, 130 those are 4.\n\nFor the four-digit numbers from 1000 to 4000, only 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, and 1004 are valid. After that, sum of the digits exceeds 4. Hence, there are 5 such numbers.\n\nAdding up all these cases, \\boxed{4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 5 = 33} pages have numbers that add to 4.", "round 1": "First, let's consider the single-digit page numbers. The only one-digit page number where the digits add up to 4 is 4 itself, giving us 1 such number.\n\nThen, we look at the two-digit page numbers. The valid two-digit numbers whose digits add up to 4 are: 13, 22, 31, and 40. That's 4 page numbers.\n\nFor the three-digit page numbers, let's remember that we can use 0 as a valid digit in this case (for example 103 is a valid three-digit number adding up to 4). That said, it's important to consider combinations without repetition (since 103 is the same as 130 or 031). \n\nWe can take the digits 0 to 4 (as any larger digit would automatically exceed the sum we're looking for), and find unique combinations that give us a sum of 4. Here are the valid combinations:\n\n- One hundred's place: 1; tens and unit places could be: 03, 12, 21, 30, which gives us 4 possibilities.\n- One hundred's place: 2; tens and unit places could be: 02, 11, 20, which gives us another 3 possibilities.\n- One hundred's place: 3; tens and unit places could be: 01, 10, which gives us 2 more possibilities.\n- One hundred's place: 4; tens and unit places could be: 00, which is just one more possibility.\n\nIn total, these possibilities add up to 10 valid three-digit page numbers.\n\nFinally, we have the four-digit page numbers. The only four-digit page number in the book is 1000, and its digits don't add up to 4, so there are no valid numbers in this category.\n\nCombining these results, we have 1 (one-digit) + 4 (two-digit) + 10 (three-digit) + 0 (four-digit) = \\boxed{15} pages in total that have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4.", "round 2": "After carefully analysing each agent's argument, let's solve the problem systematically.

So, there is exactly 1 such page number\n\n2. Two-digit page numbers: The possible two-digit combinations are 13, 22, 31, and 40. These account for 4 two-digit page numbers.\n\n3. Three-digit page numbers:\n   \n   a) With 1 as the hundred's digit, the tens and ones can be 03, 12, 21, and 30, which gives us 4 combinations.\n\n   b) With 2 as the hundred's digit, the tens and ones can be 02, 11, and 20, which gives us 3 combinations.\n   \n   c) With 3 as the hundred's digit, the tens and ones can be 01 and 10, which gives us 2 combinations.\n   \n   d) With 4 as the hundred's digit, the tens and ones can only be 00, which give us 1 combination.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 valid three-digit page numbers.\n\n4.

Three digit page numbers: we have to figure out the possible combinations whose digits add up to 4. This is slightly complex, but if we take our time, we can list them all: \n\n    - For the hundreds place, the possible digits which are less than or equal to 4 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, with 0 in the hundreds place we are left with double-digit numbers, which we have already considered. So for this reason, consider only 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the hundreds place, and let's check every case.\n\n    - If we take 1 for the hundreds place, the possible page prefixes are: 100, 111, 112, 113, 120, 121, 122, 130, 131, 140. 10 combinations.\n  \n    - If we take 2 for the hundreds place, the possible page prefixes are: 200, 202, 211, 220, 221, 230. 6 combinations.\n  \n    - If we take 3 for the hundreds place, the possible page prefixes are: 300, 301, 310, 320. 4 combinations.\n  \n    - If we take 4 for the hundreds place, the possible page prefixes are: 400, 401, 410. 3 combinations.\n\nFrom the above list, only 1000 is no valid since there are only 1000 pages in the book. Each other prefix can be followed by any digit from 0 to 9 inclusive. The count of valid pages is therefore: \n\n1(single digit) + 13(double digit) + (10+6+4+3)(three digit)*10 - 1(extra overcounted) = 1 + 13 + 230 - 1 = 243.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is \\boxed{243}.", "round 1": "Let's break down the task and consider each case.\n\n1.

Three-digit page numbers:\nUsing solution0's approach for this part, because it is the most sensible one, we can see that the hundreds digit can only be 1 because any number larger than this would result in a sum that\u2019s more than 4. The rest of the two digits must be from the group being (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,0). These are 4 possibilities, but we have to remember that each of these could be performed in two ways, for the tens and ones positions. Therefore, there are 4 * 2 = 8 possibilities in this case.\n\n4. Four-digit page numbers:\nAs for four-digit numbers, 1000 to 1003 are the only possibilities that add up to 4. So, we have 4 such page numbers.\n\nHence, adding up the numbers of pages from each case, we have 1 (from the single-digit case) + 4 (from the two-digit case) + 8 (from the three-digit case) + 4 (from the four-digit case) = \\boxed{17} pages where the sum of the digits equals 4.

Single-digit page numbers:\nThe number 4 is the only single-digit page number that adds up to precisely 4.\n\n2. Two-digit page numbers:\nThe numbers whose digits add up to 4 are: 13, 22, 31, and 40. All other pairs will either go beyond 4 or have leading zeros (like 04), which are not valid for this case.\n\n3. Three-digit page numbers:\nFor three-digit page numbers, we must keep in mind that 0 is a permissible digit, and we don't have to worry about leading zeros.\n\n- If there is a 1 in the hundred's position, the remaining two digits can be any pair that sum up to 3: 03, 12, 21, 30. We cannot use 00 since that would give us a two-digit page number which we've already counted.\n- If there is a 2 in the hundred's position, the remaining two digits can be any pair that sum up to 2: 02, 11, 20. We cannot use 00 for the same reason.\n- If there is a 3 in the hundred's position, the remaining two digits can be any pair that sum up to 1: 01, 10.

However, since we are looking for a page number within a book, we can disregard the number 4 because a book won't start page numbering from 0. Also, it should be noted that any number such as 400, 500, 600...900 won\u2019t work either, because 0 does not contribute any value to the sum of the digits.\n\na) When the page numbers are two digits:\nWe have alternatives 13, 22, 31 and 40, which makes 4 pages in total in this category.\n\nb) When the page numbers are three digits:\nWe have three regions to consider here, the hundreds, tens, and units digits.\n\n- The hundreds digit can only be 1 because any number larger than this would result in a sum that\u2019s more than 4. The rest of the two digits must be from the group (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,0). That\u2019s four choices for the rest two digits.

If the tens place is 2, then there is only one other number possible: (2,0).
