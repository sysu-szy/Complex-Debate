Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.", "answer": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 8, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 4 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^4$ or $b(g(x))^4$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^4$, which equals $ba_{n}^4x^{4n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 8, we have $4n=8$, so $n=2$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Firstly, let us understand how the degrees of polynomials work. \n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in its expression.

The degree of the composed function depends on both the degree of $f$ and $g$. We know that the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$, which means the highest power of the variable in $f(x)$ is $4$. Thus, if $g(x)$ has degree $n$, $f(g(x))$ will have degree $4n$, because each variable in g(x) to the power of $n$ will be raised to the power of $4$ in $f(g(x))$.\n\nTherefore, the function $f(g(x))$ has degree $4n$ and the function $g(x)$ has degree $n$. When adding these together to calculate $h(x)$, the resulting degree is the maximum of the two, which we know to be $8$.\n\nIf degree of $f(g(x))$ is more than the degree of $g(x)$, degree of $h(x)$ would be $4n$. But we know that it is $8$. Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$, which is $n$, should be either greater than or equal to $4n/4 = n$. That means degree of g(x) should be equal to 8 in order to make degree of $f(g(x)) =$ degree of $g(x)$ = $8$.\n\nHence, we conclude that the degree of $g(x)$ is \\boxed{8}.", "round 1": "Looking at the given problem, we have two polynomials, $f$ and $g$, and a third polynomial, $h$, which is defined by $h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$.

When we have a composition of polynomials, such as $f(g(x))$, the degree of the composite polynomial will be the product of the degrees of the composing polynomials. This comes from the fact that each time we replace a variable in $f(x)$ with $g(x)$, we're effectively multiplying the degrees.\n\nGiven that the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$, and we're substituting $x$ with $g(x)$ in $f(x)$, then the degree of $f(g(x))$ will be $4$ times the degree of $g(x)$.

The degree of this function will be four times the degree of $g(x)$, since we're replacing the $x$ in $f(x)$, which has degree $4$, with all the terms of $g(x)$. \n\nAdditionally, the degree of the polynomial $g(x)$ itself remains the same in the expression for $h(x)$. Therefore, the degree of $h(x)$ will be the maximum of the degrees of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$.\n\nSince we know that the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$, this means that the maximum of the degrees of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$ is $8$.
