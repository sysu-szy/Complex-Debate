This is because the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius (A=\u03c0r\u00b2), so when you halve the radius, the area is divided by four.\n\nSo, the diameters of the circles form a geometrical series with a common ratio of 1/2, but their areas form a different geometrical series with a common ratio of 1/4. \n\nTo calculate the sum of the areas of all the circles, we first find the area of the largest circle, which is the first term (a) in this series.

Since the area of a circle is calculated by \u03c0r\u00b2 where r is the radius, we need to understand how halving the diameter (and hence the radius) impacts the area.\n\nRecall that if the radius is halved, then the area becomes (1/2)\u00b2 or 1/4 of the original, not 1/2.
