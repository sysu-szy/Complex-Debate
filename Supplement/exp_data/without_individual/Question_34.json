Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.

This is due to the direct test for divisibility by 4: if the number formed by the last two digits of a number is divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4. \n\nRound 2: Looking at the possible pairings of our available digits, the two-digit numbers that can be formed which are divisible by 4 are 12, 24, 32, and 4... wait, it's impossible for us to use 4 as the tens digit, because we're allowed to use each digit only once and we need to use 4 as the units digit to get a number that ends in 4. Therefore, we only have three valid two-digit numbers: 12, 24, and 32. \n\nRound 3: Now that we know which choices there are for the final two digits, we can examine the possibilities for the first one or two digits (depending on whether the total number will have three or four digits).

In other words, the chosen pair should be at the end of the number.\n\n- Case 1: The remaining pair will form a two-digit number. There were 2 digits in each pair, and they could be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, we have 3 pairs * 2 possibilities each = 6 numbers.\n\n- Case 2: The remaining pair will form the first and second digits of a three-digit number. Because the pair has two distinct digits, they can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways, forming 3 pairs * 2 possibilities each = 6 numbers.\n\nSo, we have a total of 6 (four-digit numbers) + 6 (three-digit numbers) = \\boxed{12} different numbers.", "round 2": "To solve this problem, we must recognize the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. \n\nStep 1: Identify eligible two-digit endings\nThe possible two-digit numbers that are multiples of 4 which we can form using digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once are 12, 24, and 32.\n\nStep 2: Construct four-digit numbers\nLet's create the four-digit numbers first: Once we've decided on two digits to form a number divisible by 4, those will form the last two digits of the four-digit number. The remaining two digits can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways to give distinct numbers.

These are the only combinations that meet our requirement, because any permutation of odd numbers (1 and 3) at the end of the number won't make it divisible by 4. \n\nRound 2:\nWe start off by considering the possible placements of the digits. For each of the four pairs of last two digits, we have two different numbers, because there are two other digits that were not used and they could be arranged in these two positions in 2 ways (either in ascending or descending order).\n\nRound 3:\nWe then multiply the 4 options for the last two digits by the 2 arrangements for each, giving us 8 possibilities. \n\nRound 4:\nHowever, we also have the case of numbers ending with 4, with the digit before it being either 1, 2, or 3.

Once we've designated the last two digits, we have two digits left. There are 2 possible arrangements (or 2 permutations) for those two digits, meaning they can form one of two different two-digit numbers.

This leaves us with 3 digits for the first two places, which can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.

The pairs of digits that can be taken from 1,2,3,4 that are divisible by 4 are 12, 24, and 32.\n\nStep 2: Four-digit numbers. Taking those pairs as the last two digits, the remaining two digits can be arranged in 2 ways.

Now let's make three-digit numbers where the last two digits are one of the pairs identified in the first step. The remaining digit can be put in one place - the first one, so there's only one way to arrange the digits in this case.

The choice of the last two digits depends on the hundreds digit:\n\n-If it's 1, then the last two digits must be one of {24, 32} (2 choices).\n-If it's 2, then the last two digits can be one of {14, 34} (2 choices).\n-If it's 3, then the last two digits can be one of {12, 24} (2 choices).\n-If it's 4, then the last two digits must be 12 (1 choice).\n\nThus, there are 3*2 + 3*2 + 3*2 + 1 = 18 three-digit numbers that are divisible by 4.\n\nFinally, consider four-digit numbers.\nSince all four digits must be used, arranging them so that the last two digits form a number divisible by 4 results in the following possible 4-digit numbers: 1234, 1243, 1324, 1423, 2134, 2143, 3412 and 4312.
