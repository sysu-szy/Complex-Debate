{"question": "Jane has been growing two bacteria farms.\n\nBacteria farm Rod has a starting population of 2 bacteria, while Bacteria farm Sphere has a starting population of 8 bacteria.  However, Jane starts growing Rod five hours before she starts growing Sphere.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Jane checks her farms and finds that they have the exact same population. If the population of Rod doubles every hour, but the population of Sphere is quadrupled every hour, how many hours ago did she start growing Sphere?", "answer": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's name the moment Jane checks her farms as time t=0. \n\nThe population of bacteria in farm Rod and Sphere at any given time t (in hours) can be represented using exponential growth formula, which for the given problem can be simply written as:\n\nRod(t) = 2 * 2^t  (since the bacteria population doubles every hour, hence 2 raised to the power t)\nSphere(t) = 8 * 4^t (since the bacteria population quadruples every hour, hence 4 raised to the power t)\n\nWe know that Jane starts growing Rod five hours before she starts growing Sphere, so at time t=0, the age of Rod is (t+5) hours. This means that the population of Rod at t=0 would be:\nRod(0) = 2 * 2^(0+5) = 2 * 2^5 = 2 * 32 = 64\n\nGiven that at time t=0, the population of both Rod and Sphere are same, this means that the population of Sphere at t=0 is also 64. Hence, we can write:\nSphere(t) = 64\nFrom Sphere\u2019s growth equation, we can write:\n8 * 4^t = 64\nSimplifying above equation gives: \n4^t = 64 / 8\n4^t = 8\nAs 8 = 2^3, we can say (4^t) = (2^2)^3.
