This function $f(x)$ is in fact a sawtooth wave with period $1$. Notably, if we map the interval $[0, 1]$ to itself under the function $f$, we find that\n\\[f([0, 1]) = [0, 1], \\]\nBut if we partition the interval $[0, 1]$ into two equal parts, $[0, 1/2]$ and $[1/2, 1]$, we find that\n\\[f([0, 1/2]) = f([1/2, 1]) = [0, 1], \\]\nwhich means that under the mapping of $f$, the interval $[0, 1]$ is 'doubly covered'.\n\nNow, when we iterate this mapping by applying it again via $f^{[2]}(x) = f(f(x))$, we effectively partition the interval into $2^2 = 4$ equal parts, and each of them map to the interval $[0, 1]$. This can be extended to $f^{[n]}(x)$, where the interval $[0, 1]$ is divided into $2^n$ equal parts, and each of them map to $[0, 1]$.\n\nNow, consider the equation $f^{[2005]}(x) = 1/2$. As we just argued, the partition induced by $f^{[2005]}$ has $2^{2005}$ equal parts, and by symmetry, exactly half of them will have end points that map to values smaller than $1/2$, and the other half to values larger than $1/2$. \n\nThus, there are $2^{2004}$ values of $x$ for which $f^{[2005]}(x) = 1/2$.\n\nIt is important to note here though that this might seem like 0 and 1 should be excluded since technically $f^{[1]}(0) = 0$ and $f^{[1]}(1) = 2$, but according to the definition given in the problem, $f^{[2]}(0) = f^{[1]}(f(0)) = f^{[1]}(0) = 0$ (and similarly for 1), so the end points of all intervals still get mapped to 0 or 1, thus letting the end points lie under the remit of the formula we found. We also note that there is exactly one point in each interval that gets mapped to 1/2, thus guaranteeing that the number of points we found is indeed the number of *unique* points, ensuring it fulfills the criteria that they are distinct. \n\nNow, we can rewrite $2^{2004}$ in the form $p^a$ as follows:\n\\[ p^a = 2^{2^{11}} \\]\n\nSo, $p = 2$ and $a = 2^{11}$,\nhence $p + a = 2 + 2^{11} = \\boxed{2050}$.", "round 1": "Looking at the insights from all agents, it is clear that the key observation is how the function $f(x)$ affects the binary representation of $x$.

We want this digit to be 1, which corresponds to $\\frac{1}{2}$ in binary.\n\nThe remaining 2005 digits to the right of the $2006^{th}$ digit are unaffected by the operations of the function and can be either 0 or 1.\n\nThus the number of possible $x$ is simply all possible arrangements of the 2005 binary digits, which is $2^{2005} = 2^{5 \\times 401}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions can be expressed in the form $p^a$ where $p=2$ and $a=5\\times401 = 2005$.\n\nSo, the answer is $p+a = 2+2005 = \\boxed{2007}$.", "round 2": "Considering the given function and its definition on the interval $[0,1]$, we can easily notice a binary operation effect on the number $x$. The function, in fact, either doubles $x$ for $x$ in $[0,1/2]$ or doubles it and subtracts the result from $2$, which is equivalent to a reflection, for $x$ in $[1/2,1]$. \n\nTherefore, in binary form, $f(x)$ performs a shift operation on the binary representation of $x$. If we denote $x$ in a binary form where the first digit after the binary point is $a_1$, the second digit is $a_2$ and so forth, the function $f(x)$ essentially removes the first digit $a_1$ after the binary point, shifts every other digit one place to the left, and places a $0$ as the last digit. This operation is performed each time we apply $f$.\n\nLet's focus now on the condition $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$, where $f^{[n]}$ is the $n^{th}$ composition of the function $f(x)$ with itself. We are looking for numbers $x$ that, after employing the function $f$ for 2005 times, will result in the number $\\frac {1}{2}$ which in binary is represented as $0.1$.\n\nThe function $f$ when applied shifts the binary digits one step to the left.

Therefore, the only solution to this equation would be when $x = 2^n = 0 \\mod 1$, or when $x = 0$.  \n\nHowever, looking back to the original function $f^{[n]}(x)$, another solution would be when $f^{[n - 1]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$, and $f^{[n - 1]}(x)$ doubles to get to $1$, which then goes back to $0$ to satisfy the end condition. Therefore, for every $n$, there are two unique solutions. \n\nAfter here, be careful for overcounts: Keep in mind that the valid outputs of $2^n$ are between $0$ and $1$. Thus, the solution to $f^{[n]}$ is always shared with $f^{[n - 1]}$ for where $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac {1}{2}$. Since $f^{[n]}(x)$ continues on to infinity, all choices of $n$ will have $f^{[n]}(0) = 0$ and $f^{[n]}(0.5) = 0$. Hence, since $f^{[2005]} = \\frac {1}{2}$ involves finding $f^{[k]}(f^{[2005 - k]}) = \\frac {1}{2}$, $f^{[k]}$ will return $0.5$ twice only at a specific $f^{[2005 - k]}(x)$ defined by the $n = k$ condition. \n\nTherefore, the only times when $f^{[k]}(x) = \\frac {1}{2}$ only once, which provides a new solution, is when $f^{[k]}(x)$ has only one case, or that $n = 1$ and $n = 2$: at $n = 1$, $f^{[n]}(0) = 0$ and $f^{[n]}(\\frac {1}{4}) = 0.5$; at $n = 2$, $f^{[n]}(0) = 0$ and $f^{[n]}(\\frac {1}{4}) = 0$, and $f^{[n]}(\\frac {1}{8}) = 0.5$. \n\nHence, considering the overcounts (which, from the previous arguments, have doubled solutions for every composite number of $n$, and have quadrupled solutions for every square number of $n$), there is $1^2 + 2^2 + (3\\cdot2)^2 + (2^2)^2 + \\cdots$ total solutions, anything larger than $2^3$ excluded due to the bounded function.

This behaviour of the function can be conveniently represented by stating that it operates by shifting the binary (i.e. base 2) representation of $x$ one position to the left, where any overflow beyond the binary point (.1 to .0) is dropped.\n\nNow, $f^{[2005]}(x)$ involves applying this operation 2005 times, and we are looking for those $x$ which result in a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$ after these 2005 operations.
