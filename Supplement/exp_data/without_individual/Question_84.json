However, in this case, we don't know the slant height L which is required to calculate the lateral surface area. We can instead calculate it using the Pythagorean theorem. In a cross-section of the frustum, we can form a right-angled triangle with half of the larger base's diameter (10 cm), the height of the frustum (8 cm), and the slant height as the hypotenuse. So, L = \u221a(8^2 + 10^2) = \u221a164 cm.\n\nNow we can calculate the lateral surface area. The circumferences C1 and C2 can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is \u03c0 times the diameter.

The areas A1 and A2 of the smaller and larger bases can be found by using the formula for the area of a circle, which is \u03c0 times the square of the radius (or \u03c0 times 0.25 times the square of the diameter). Hence, A1 = \u03c0 * (0.25 * 8^2) = 16\u03c0 cm^2 and A2 = \u03c0 * (0.25 * 20^2) = 100\u03c0 cm^2.\n\nRound 4: Calculating the Total Surface Area \n\nFinally, we add the lateral surface area to the summed base areas to get the total surface area. So, the total surface area = 14\u221a164 \u03c0 + 16\u03c0 + 100\u03c0 = (14\u221a164 + 116)\u03c0 cm^2. \n\nSo my final answer is \\boxed{{(14\\sqrt{164} + 116)\\pi}} square cm.", "round 1": "The surface area of a frustum can be calculated by summing the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area. \n\nFirst of all, we know the radii of the two circular faces as half of the diameters (20 cm and 8 cm) which are 10 cm and 4 cm respectively.

But here most fellow agents made a mistake. The slant height is determined by a right triangle formed by the frustum height, the half-difference of the diameters of the two bases, and the slant height itself. \n\nSo, to get the value of L, we form a right triangle in which one side is half of the difference of radii (10cm - 4cm = 6cm, so half of the difference is 3cm) and another side is the height of the frustum (8cm).

The formula for the lateral surface area of a frustum is 0.5 * L * (C1+C2), where L is the slant height and C1 and C2 are the circumferences of the bases.\n\nHowever, L is not given, but we can calculate it. The vertical height of the frustum is 8cm, and we can form a right triangle with L as the hypotenuse and the other two sides as the height and half the difference between the two radii (which is (10-4)/2 = 3cm - representing the side of the smaller triangle if you imagine unrolling the frustum into a flat shape). So, using the Pythagorean theorem, L = \u221a(8\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a73 cm.\n\nThe circumferences of the bases can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = \u03c0D):\n\nC1 (smaller base) = \u03c0 * 8cm = 8\u03c0 cm\nC2 (larger base) = \u03c0 * 20cm = 20\u03c0 cm\n\nUsing these values in the LSA formula, we get:\n\nLSA = 0.5 * \u221a73 * (8\u03c0 + 20\u03c0) = 14\u221a73 \u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nFinally, the total surface area (TSA) is the sum of A1, A2, and LSA:\n\nTSA = A1 + A2 + LSA = 100\u03c0 + 16\u03c0 + 14\u221a73\u03c0 = (14\u221a73 + 116)\u03c0 cm\u00b2 \n\nHence, the total surface area of the frustum in square centimeters is \\boxed{(14\\sqrt{73} + 116)\\pi}."}]}
