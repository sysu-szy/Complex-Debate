The smallest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, and the largest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. After testing, we find that \\begin{align*}6 = 2+2+2,\\ 8 = 4+2+2,\\ 10 = 4+4+2, \\\\ 12 = 4+4+4,\\ 14 = 8+4+2,\\ 16 = 8+4+4, \\\\ 18 = 8+8+2,\\ 20 = 8+8+4,\\ 24 = 8+8+8.\\end{align*} However, we cannot find a combination that will add to be $22$: if two of the numbers are not $8$, then the maximum possible sum is $4 + 4 + 8 = 16$. Thus, two of the numbers picked must be $8$, but then the third ball must have the number $6$, which is not possible.

This is because the selection of numbers can be varied to achieve all these sums. \n\nFor example, to get a sum of $7$, we could select the balls labeled $2$, $2$, and $3$; to get a sum of $18$, we could select the balls labeled $8$, $8$, and $2$; and so on.

Conversely, the maximum possible sum is obtained when the ball labeled \"8\" is picked all three times, which gives a sum of 8*3 = 24.\n\nThe crucial piece of information is realizing that all sums between 6 and 24 (inclusive) can be achieved. This is because the selection of numbers (2, 4, 8) can be varied to result in all these sums.

A sum of 18 can be achieved by selecting the balls labeled \"8\" twice and the ball labeled \"2\" once, and so forth. Thus, every integer between 6 and 24 (inclusive) is a possible sum.\n\nThe best way to find the sum of these possible sums is by taking the sum of all integers from 6 to 24 (inclusive). This can be efficiently calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nIn this case, our first term is 6, our last term is 24, and the number of terms is 24 - 6 + 1 = 19.\n\nSo the sum of all the possible distinct sums is:\n\nSum = 19/2 * (6 + 24) = 285\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the possible distinct sums is \\boxed{285}.", "round 2": "First, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes of picking a ball from the bag three times with replacement.

The smallest sum we can get is $6$ (which happens when we select the ball labelled \"2\" on all three turns). The largest sum, conversely, is $24$ (which happens when we select the ball labelled \"8\" on all three turns).\n\nIt is important to recognize that any sum falling between $6$ and $24$ (inclusive) is indeed possible. This is because we can adjust the order and combination of our three picks to achieve these totals. For example, to achieve a sum of $10$, we could select \"2\", \"2\", and \"4\", or \"2\", \"4\", \"4\", or even \"4\", \"2\", \"4\". Likewise, for sums of other values between 6 and 24, we could adjust our selections accordingly. \n\nTherefore, every number between $6$ and $24$ (inclusive) can be a possible sum. \n\nTo find the total of all possible sums, we can apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by $\\frac{n}{2}*(a+l)$, where \"n\" is the number of terms, \"a\" is the first term, and \"l\" is the last term.\n\nThe first term (a) is $6$ and the last term (l) is $24$.

Because there are three rounds, the total number of outcomes will be $3^{3}=27$.\n\nNote that the smallest possible sum is $2+2+2=6$, and the largest is $8+8+8=24$. All the sums from 6 to 24 are possible with various combinations. To simplify determination of the possible sums, note that there can only be three 2's, three 4's, or three 8's. There cannot be two 2's and an 8 (which would sum to 12), because 12 can also be accomplished with two 4's and a 2. Similarly, 14 can be achieved in multiple ways as well (three 4's, or two 2's and an 8). \n\nSo, the only unique sums possible are those made up of three of the same ball. If we had three distinct balls then we have a problem with our reasoning; the logic isn't clear. Therefore, we need to find sums of the balls in all combinations and order and eliminate duplicate sums.\n\nUnique sums are 6 (2+2+2), 12 (4+4+4), 18 (6+6+6), and all the possible values from 6 to 24 (inclusive) because of the different combinations of the balls (2,4,8).

Any sum falling between 6 and 24 (inclusive) is indeed possible, because we can adjust our selections from the bag across the three turns to reach these values.\n\nFor example, if we want to reach a sum of 10, we could select \"2\", \"2\", and \"4\", or \"2\", \"4\", \"4\", or even select \"8\", \"2\" on any combination of turns.

Therefore, there are indeed $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^3 = 27$ possible outcomes.\n\nHowever, the common point of contention appears to be on the calculation of the sum of the distinct possible sums. And the confusion lies in whether or not each integer value between the smallest possible sum and the largest possible sum can be obtained. The smallest possible sum is 6 (if we select the ball numbered 2 three times) and the largest possible sum is 24 (if we select the ball numbered 8 three times).\n\nThe agents correctly point out that not only can the smallest and largest sums be obtained, but also any sum between 6 and 24 (inclusive) can be obtained by appropriately selecting the balls in the three rounds. We can achieve any of these sums through various combinations of the numbers {2,4,8} three times. For example, a sum of 10 could be obtained by selecting 2, 2, and 4 in any order.
