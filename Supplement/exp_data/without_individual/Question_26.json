Such an inverse exists only if 6 and m are relatively prime i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1.\n\nThe condition $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$ means that the multiplicative inverse of 6 mod m and the square of 6 are congruent mod m, i.e., they leave the same remainder when divided by m.\n\nSince the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10, and 6 and multiples of 5 is greater than 1, m cannot end in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 8.
