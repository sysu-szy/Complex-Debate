To verify that $x = 3$ is indeed a solution, we can check for continuity in the function at $x = 3$. By substituting $x = 3$ back into the function $f(x)$, we can confirm that $f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0$, so $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find the inverse $f^{-1}(6)$, which is the value of $x$ that makes $f(x) = 6$.\n\nFor $x > 3$, the function $f(x) = -x^3+2x^2+3x$.\nSetting $f(x) = 6$, we find\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0$,\nwhich simplifies to\n$x^3-2x^2-3x+6 = 0$.\nBy close examination or by the rational root theorem, we find $x = 3$ is a root of this cubic equation.

Since 0 is within the range of the first part of the piecewise function, we should look for the solution for the condition $x \\leq 3$.\n\nWhen $x \\leq 3$, $f(x) = 3 - x$.

Setting $f(x) = 6$ gives us $-x^3+2x^2+3x-6=0$.\n\nIn order to solve this cubic equation, we might think about the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, or other factoring techniques. Trying out possible rational roots, we see that x = 4 is indeed a root since when we plug x = 4 into the equation, we get $(-4^3)+2(4^2)+3(4)-6=-64+32+12-6=26-26=0$.\n\nTherefore, the factor theorem tells us that \"(x-4)\" is a factor, and we can then divide the cubic polynomial by (x-4) to get the other factor (x^2-2x+3) which upon solving gives complex roots that we dismiss. Hence, $f^{-1}(6) = 4$. \n\nFinally, we have to find $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6)$. Adding our solutions, $f^{-1}(0) = 3$ and $f^{-1}(6) = 4$, we reach the final answer: $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 4 = 7$. \n\nSo, the solution to the problem is \\boxed{7}.", "round 2": "Let's carefully examine the problem again, including the analysis and solutions provided by other agents.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined as a piecewise function, separated by the condition $x=3$.\n\nThe first step is to find $f^{-1}(0)$, the inverse of $f(x)$ when $f(x)=0$.\n\nFrom the definition of $f(x)$, when $x\\leq 3$, the function is given as $f(x)=3-x$.
