{"question": "The $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?", "answer": "Suppose the smallest of Bill's numbers is $b$. The next few terms of the sequence are $br$, $br^2$, $br^3$, $br^4$, and so on. Since $r$ is at least 2, $br^4$ is at least $16b$. Since $16b > 10b$, and $10b$ has one more digit than $b$, $16b$ has more digits than $b$, and therefore $br^4$ has more digits than $b$. Since the series increases, $br^5$, $br^6$, and so on all have more digits than $b$. Therefore, Bill's numbers are restricted to $b$, $br$, $br^2$, and $br^3$; that is, he can have at most 4 numbers. An example of this is the sequence $1,\\,2,\\,4,\\,8,\\,16,\\ldots$, where Bill's numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

Given that $a$ and $r$ are both positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1, we're asked how many of these numbers with the same amount of digits Bill can pick out.\n\nA good approach to this problem is given in agent solution1 and agent solution2. These solutions show us that the number of digits in a term depends on the term's value in relation to the powers of 10. We subsequently determine whether a term has $d$ digits by whether it falls within a certain interval of values.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum amount of numbers that can fall into this interval.

The number of terms that can be picked out from this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits, is what we need to determine.\n\nSuppose that a term has $d$ digits. This means that this term is no less than $10^{d-1}$ and less than $10^d$. We can express this as $10^{d-1} \\le a\\cdot r^{n-1} < 10^d$.\n\nTo make this inequality more manageable, we take the logarithm base 10 of all terms.

Furthermore, because each term is found by multiplying the previous term by $r$, the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, if the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence has $d$ digits, all of the terms from the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term to the $(n+k-1)^{\\text{th}}$ term (inclusive) will also have $d$ digits as long as $a\\cdot r^{n+k-2}<10^d$ and $a\\cdot r^{n-1}\\ge 10^{d-1}$.\n\nWe're looking for the maximum possible value of $k$, so let's examine when a new digit is added.
