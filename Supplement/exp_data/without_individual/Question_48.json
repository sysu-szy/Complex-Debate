The whole number part of our sum is 12, and since 12.548293386917137 is greater than 12 but less than the next consecutive integer, 13, it's clear that this sum lies between 12 and 13.\n\nThus, the sum $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}$ is located between the numbers 12 and 13 on the number line.\n\nReturning to the original question, the two consecutive integers $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}$ lies between are 12 and 13. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem in the specified form is \\boxed{12 \\text{ and } 13}.", "round 2": "The problem asks to determine the two consecutive integers that the sum $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}$ lies between. \n\nStep 1: First, evaluate the square roots. \n$\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.47722557505166$ \n$\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.0710678118654755$\n\nStep 2: Add the two values obtained from the square roots. \n$5.47722557505166 + 7.0710678118654755 = 12.548293386917137$\n\nStep 3: Identify the two consecutive integers that 12.548293386917137 lies between.
