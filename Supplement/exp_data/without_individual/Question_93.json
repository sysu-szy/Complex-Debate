We need those translated lines to never intersect $f(x)$. Let's go through the case $b = 1$ to illustrate this: the slope of $f(1) = x$ is $1$, so the graphs of $f(x)$ and $f(1)$ are parallel. If $b = 1$, there exists such $x$ that $f(x) = f(1) \\cdot x$, then $f(x) + f(1) \\cdot x$ would not be injective (or invertible). Hence, $b$ cannot be $1$ (nor $-1$).

The function $g(x)$ is the function $f(x)$ \"moved\" downward, as the slope $a$ is negative. Therefore, we are looking for the largest negative slope in the function $f(x)$. This slope is $-4$, yet, if $a = -4$, the function will not be invertible, once the second and the third line segments will become flat. Therefore, to guarantee that $g(x)$ is decreasing, $a$ must be slightly larger than $-4$, and the largest integer that satisfies this is $a = -3$.\n\nNow, for function $h(x) = f(x) + bx$, as $b$ is positive, the function is $f(x)$ \"moved\" upward. We need to find the slope $b$ such that $h(x)$ is monotonically increasing. The smallest slope from the $f(x)$ graph is $0$. However, this is not sufficient since the zero slope is on the rightmost line segment. Hence it does not prevent the fourth line segment, with a positive slope of $\\frac{7}{2}$, from making the translated line cross itself.

This is just a restatement of the fact that an invertible function must be one-to-one (each input corresponds to exactly one output and vice versa).\n\nThe graph of the function $g(x) = f(x) + ax$, where $a$ is a constant, is simply the graph of $f(x)$ shifted according to the slope of $a$. A line with slope $a$ intercepts the $x$-axis at the origin, so for negative $a$, the line will be decreasing.\n\nTo ensure that $g(x)$ is invertible, we want to avoid the graph crossing over itself when it is shifted. This will occur if the slope of $f(x)$ becomes less than $a$.\n\nFor $f(x)=ax$, we can see from the graph that as $a$ gets smaller (more negative), the line intersects the $y$ axis at lower points. To find the value of $a$ such that the function is still invertible, we look for the line, with negative slope, that is tangent to the graph of $f(x)$ at its highest pint. \n\nDoing so shows us that the line with equation $y = 3x + 9$ is tangent to the function at $x = -2$. \n\nHence, we have $a = 3$.\n\nRound 2: Finding the Slope of the Tangent\n\nNext, for a positive slope $b$, the lines $y = f(x) + bx$ will shift upwards to the right.

A function is invertible when it is bijective, which implies that it is strictly increasing or decreasing. In the context of our problem, given a function $f(x)$, adding a term with a positive slope will shift the function upwards whereas adding a term with a negative slope will shift the function downwards. For invertibility, we need to avoid the shifted function crossing over itself. The critical points to consider are the sharp turns on the function graph, specifically at $x=-5, -2, -1, 1, 3,$ and $5$.\n\nIn the case of $g(x)=f(x)+ax$, as $a$ is negative, our line is decreasing. Thus, $f(x)+ax$ has a lower limit, which is imposed by the maximum negative slope of $f(x)$. If $a$ is less than this maximum negative slope, then the function will not be invertible as it will \"loop\" around and fail the horizontal line test. Hence, the value of $a$ must be larger than the maximum negative slope of $f(x)$.
