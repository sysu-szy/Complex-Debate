The final answer was the sum of these two solved variables.", "round 2": "There seems to be a lot of discrepancy among the different agents' solutions, though the idea of using both the given function and its inverse function is consistently applied. Let's resolve this question correctly.\n\nWe have the function $f(x) = \\frac{-px - 3}{-qx + 3}$, and its inverse function $g(x)$, with the same pair of points (7, -22) lying on the graphs of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. \n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Given that the point (7, -22) is on the graph of $f(x)$, substitute x as 7 and f(x) as -22 into the function $f(x)$ to get the first equation:\n\n\\[-22 = \\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3}.\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation by cross multiplying, we obtain:\n\n\\[154q+66 = 7p.\\] -----(1)\n\nStep 2: The point (7, -22) also lies on the graph of $g(x)$, the inverse of $f(x)$. Remember, for inverse functions, the x and y values swap places. So, substitute x as -22 and g(x) as 7 into the equation of $f(x)$ (since g(x) is the inverse of f(x), they are essentially the same function, just with the x and y swapped) to give the second equation:\n\n\\[7 = \\frac{22p + 3}{22q + 3}.\\]\n\nSimilar to Step 1, simplify this equation by cross multiplying, we have:\n\n\\[154q - 21 = 7p.\\] -----(2)\n\nStep 3: Now we have a system of two equations (Eqn 1 and Eqn 2) in terms of p and q. By subtracting Eqn (2) from Eqn (1), we get:\n\n\\[66 + 21 = 7p - (-7p) \\]\n\\[87 = 14p.\\]\nSo, $p = 87/14 = 6.2143$.\n\nStep 4: Substitute $p = 6.2143$ into Eqn (1) then solve for q:\n\n\\[154q+66 = 7(6.2143)\\]\n\\[154q = 43.5 - 66 \\]\n\\[q = -22.5/154 = -0.1461 \\]\n\nStep 5: Thus, $p + q = 6.2143 + (-0.1461) = 6.0682$.\n\nTherefore, our final solution is \\boxed{6.0682}."}]}
