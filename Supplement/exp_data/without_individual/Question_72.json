The remaining 20% are in Group B, thus there are 20 students in Group B. \n\nSimilarly, Group A shares 40% of the candies, meaning they share 40 candies, and Group B shares the remaining 60% of the candies, meaning they share 60 candies. \n\nRound 3: \n\nEach student in a group shares the candies equally, so we can find out how many candies each student in each group gets by dividing the total number of candies in each group by the total number of students in each group. \n\nIn Group A, there are 40 candies among 80 students.
