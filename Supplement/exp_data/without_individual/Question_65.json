Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product.", "answer": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$.

The problem statement translates into the following equations:\n\nx*y+x+y=454 and we are looking to find the maximum value for (x+y)*(x*y).\n\nLet's rewrite the first equation as x*y+x+y-454=0. This can be seen as a quadratic equation in x (or similarly in y), a*x^2 + b*x +c = 0, where a=y, b=1, and c=-454 in this case. The solutions of this type of quadratic equation are given by the formula x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4*a*c)] / 2*a. \n\nFor any quadratic with real roots (which we know x and y are), the roots are symmetric around x = -b/2a. Therefore, in this context, the sum of x and y is the same as twice the value of -b/2a, or simply -b/a which is equal to -1/y.\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get x*2*-1/y+2*(-1/y) = 454, which further simplifies into -2x-2=y, thus y=-2x-2.\n\nNow, we substitute y into the sought after expression (x+y)*(x*y):\n\n(x+(-2x-2))*(x*(-2x-2))= -x^2*(2x+2)\n\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to x yields a derivative of -4x^3-4x^2. Setting this equal to zero to find the maximum, we get x*(4x^2+4x)=0, thus x=0 or x=-1.\n\nGiven the two positive integers, x cannot equal zero, hence x=-1. Substituting this back into the equation y=-2x-2, we get y = -2*(-1)-2 = 0.\n\nThis leads to an impossible condition, as integers x and y cannot be 0 and -1, since they are given to be positive. So our step to interpret y=-2x-2 was wrong.\n\nLet's correct this and return to the first equation: x*y+x+y = 454. If we view this as the sum of y and the product of (x+1) and y, we can simplify it to y*(x+1)=454-y. If we plot this as a function of y, it depicts a downward transition of a quadratic. The maximum value of this function will occur at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a function in standard form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/(2a). In this case, a=(x+1) and b=-1. Hence, the maximum value when y=-b/2a or y=1/2*(x+1).\n\nWhen we substitute y=1/2*(x+1) back to the first equation, we get\nx*(1/2*(x+1))+(1/2*(x+1)) = 454. Simplifying this equation gives x^2/2 + 3/2*x + 1 - 454 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we obtain x=-3\u00b1 sqrt(9+4*453)/2. As x is positive, we select the positive root, x= sqrt(9+4*453)/2 - 3/2.\n\nSubstitute x back into y=1/2*(x+1), we get y = 1/2*(sqrt(9+4*453)/2 - 3/2 +1).\n\nNow we substitute these x and y values into the expression (x+y)*(x*y) to find its maximum value:\n\n((-1 + sqrt(1813))/2 + (sqrt(1813)/4 - 1/2))/2 * ((-1 + sqrt(1813))/2 * (sqrt(1813)/4 - 1/2))\n= (-1 + sqrt(1813))^2/16\n\nSo, the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product is \\boxed{{(-1 + sqrt(1813))^2/16}}.", "round 1": "The problem consists of two parts.
