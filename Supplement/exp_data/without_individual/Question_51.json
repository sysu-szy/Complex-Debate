Therefore, it suffices to prove the formula for a dense subset of real numbers, e.g., for rational numbers. \n\nSecondly, again using continuity and differentiability, we can also infer that if for some $x_0$, we have $P(x_0)=y_0$, then the following formula holds:\n\n$$P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x  \\implies  P(P(x) + x) = 6x + y_0 $$\n\nThis indicates that P(x) is a linear function (in other words, of the form $Px = mx + b$ for some $m$ and $b$) which auto-implies the formula above.\n\nThen we assume $P(x) = mx + b$.

We have $P(a)+a=6(-a)$, but remember from earlier that $P(a)+a=0$, so we must have $0=6(-a)$, so $a=0$.\n\nSo we have concluded that $P(0)=0$.\n\nAssume $P(x)=mx+b$ (a linear function), then we have $P(P(x))=P(mx+b)=m^2x+mb+b$ and $P(x) = mx+b$.

The original equation is provided as $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x$. The symmetry of this equation regarding $P(x)$ and $x$ suggests that $P(x)$ could be a linear transformation of $x$. Therefore we begin by presuming that $P(x) = ax + b$, where 'a' and 'b' are constants yet to be established.\n\n2.

For this equation to hold true for all real $x$, we impose that $a^2 + a = 6$ (equating coefficients of x) and $2b+2a=0$ (equating constant terms). From these conditions, we quickly see from the second equation that $b = -a$.\n\n4. Replacing $b$ with $-a$ in the first equation results in a quadratic equation, specifically, $a^2 + a - 6 = 0$. We can factorize this quadratic to $(a-2)(a+3) = 0$. Hence, we get $a = 2$ or $a = -3$, providing two possible values for 'a'.\n\n5. Since we earlier stated 'b = -a', 'b' would then take the values $-2$ and $3$.\n\n6. Having found the possible values for 'a' and 'b', the two possible polynomials are $P(x) = 2x-2$ and $P(x) = -3x+3$.\n\n7. To find $P(10)$, we substitute $x = 10$ into both polynomials, calculating the resulting values. We get $P(10) = 20 - 2 = 18$ for the first polynomial and $P(10) = -30 + 3 = -27$ for the second polynomial.\n\n8. The question asks for the sum of all the possible values for $P(10)$.
