{"question": "Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?", "answer": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, we have to consider how many factors a number has, as these will represent the different rectangular figures that Emma can form. Specifically, we're interested in the lowest possible number with ten factors. \n\nFactors always come in pairs (excluding perfect squares where one number is repeated), so we know the number must either have five pairs of factors (which would make it a perfect square), or four pairs of factors and one repeated factor (making it a cube).\n\nFor perfect squares, we know that the number of factors is equal to 2n where n is the number of prime factors. So, a square number with ten factors would need five prime factors. The smallest possible combination of these is 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 (or $2^5 = 32$), but that only gives us one possible rectangle (32 x 1), which isn't enough.\n\nFor cubes, the number of factors is equal to 3n where n is the number of prime factors. The smallest cube with ten factors therefore needs four prime factors, the smallest combination of which is 2, 2, 2, 3 (or $2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24$). However, this only gives us eight possible rectangles, which is still not enough.\n\nSo, we need a number with more than one pair of repeated prime factors.

The total number of tiles that Emma has can be arranged into different rectangular figures. This essentially is a reference to the number of divisors that the number has. For example, if Emma had a total of 8 tiles, she could arrange those into rectangular figures of 1 by 8 or 2 by 4, which are essentially the two divisors of 8.\n\nGiven the question states that Emma can arrange her tiles into exactly ten different rectangular figures, we can deduce that the total number of tiles she has is equal to a number with 10 divisors.\n\nA number's total amount of divisors depends on its prime factorization. Specifically, we can calculate the number of divisors by taking the product of the 'exponent plus one' for each prime number in the prime factorization. \n\nTo get a total of ten divisors, there are three potential combinations:\n\n1. The number is the product of four different primes (since (1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 16, which is more than 10, this combination is ruled out).\n\n2. The number is the cube of a prime number and a distinct prime number (since (3+1) * (1+1) = 8 which is less than 10, this combination is also ruled out).\n\n3. The number is the square of a prime number and a square of a different prime (since (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 which is less than 10, we need one more unique factor so that it becomes 10. We can achieve this only by repeating one of the primes. So, the final form must be something like $p^2 * q^2 * r^1$ where 'p', 'q', and 'r' are primes. To minimize the product, we take the three smallest primes 2, 3, and 5.\n\nThis results in $2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is \\boxed{180}.", "round 2": "The problem asks for the least number of tiles Emma could have if she can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. \n\nThis problem is based on the concept of the number of divisors a number has.

Specifically, the number of factors is defined as the product of \"exponent + 1\" for each prime in the prime factorization.\n\nTo figure out the least number of tiles Emma could have, we need to find the smallest number that has exactly 20 divisors. There is only one prime factorization of 20, which is 20=2*2*5.\n\nWe need to find a combination of exponents such that when we add 1 to each and then multiply them together, we get 20. There are a few possible sets of exponents: {19}, {9,1}, {4,3}, and {4,1,1}. We need to pick the one which yields the smallest result when applied to the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5...).\n\nClearly, putting 19 on the 2 gives us 2^19, which is quite large.\n\nPutting 9 on the 2 and 1 on the 3 gives us 2^9 * 3^1 = 1536.\n\nPutting 4 on the 2, 3 on the 3 gives us 2^4 * 3^3 = 432.\n\nFinally, putting 4 on the 2, 1 on the 3 and 1 on the 5 gives us 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 180.\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is \\boxed{180}."}, {"round 0": "The number of rectangular figures that can be formed from a single set of tiles corresponds to the number of factors that the number of tiles has (since you can form a rectangle with sides of lengths equal to any two different factors).\n\nGiven that Emma can form exactly ten different rectangular figures, this implies that the number of tiles has ten factors. Considering that the number of factors for any number n is equal to the product of (e+1) for all e in the prime factorization of n (where e is the exponent of each prime number in the prime factorization), this means that Emma's number of tiles must be a product of prime numbers such that the product of (e+1) for all e in the prime factorization is equal to 10.\n\nThe prime factorization can be done in two ways to get 10 factors: \n\n1) Emma's number of tiles is a ninth power of a prime number (since (9+1)=10), as n=p^9.

So we need to adjust the factors by half when considering the number of rectangular formations. In this case, you should count the divisors as pairs, and when the number of divisors is odd, the number is a perfect square, and the central divisor (which pairs with itself) should be counted once, not twice.\n\nSo, we actually need to look for a number with 20 factors to account for the halving of possibilities due to the indistinguishable rearrangements. \n\nNow, to get twenty factors, consider a prime factorization of the form p^9 * q, since (9 + 1)*(1 + 1) = 20.

If N has exactly 10 divisors, there are two possibilities for its prime factorization:\n\n1. It is a product of two primes. The primes must be distinct since if they were the same, the number of divisors would be three, not ten. Thus, N should be of the form $p^1\u22c5q^1$, where $p$ and $q$ are different prime numbers.

Since we're looking for the smallest number of tiles she could possibly have, consider that the factors of $10$ are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$. A rectangular formation can be represented as a form of multiplication: one number (length) times another (width) equals the total amount of tiles. Bearing in mind that a $5$ by $7$ rectangle is considered the same as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle, this means that the number of factors due to multiplication (i.e., the distinct rectangles) will always be about half of the actual factors of the total number of tiles, skewed towards the side of larger numbers in case of odd number of factors (e.g., (1,5,5,25), where there are $4$ factors but only $3$ unique rectangles). \n\nSo, you'd want to find the smallest possible number that has $2*10=20$ or $2*10+1=21$ factors. For example, the number $1*2*3=6$ has $2^3=8$ factors and the number $2^2*3^2=36$ has $(2+1)(2+1)=9$ factors because the number of factors will be the product of adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization (a principle of combinatorics and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). \n\nTo minimize the number, start by using the smallest prime number: $2$. $2^1$ gives $2$ factors, so necessitates $2$, $2^2$ gives $3$ factors etc. Then, when you can't repeat a prime number any more (because you'll exceed 20 factors), move onto the next smallest prime number: $3$. So, $2^{19}$ has $20$ factors, which fits the criteria, but we're looking for the smallest number possible, so we'll find out if we can substitute some $2$s with $3$s. \n\nThe opening for substitution is done by preferring $3^2 (=9)$ over $2^4 (=16)$ since both result in equal increase in factors (4+1 = 3+1 = 2). \nThus the resultant number could be $2^{19}$.\n\nHowever, on closer inspection, we could substitute $2^3*3^2$ for $2^6$, since $2*3^2$ produces $2*2*3 = 12$ factors and $2^6$ produces only $6+1=7$ factors.\nThis means you will replace $2^6$ (equals to 64) with $3^2*2^3$ (equals to 72) which increases our factors by 5 (from 7 to 12) but also increases our value.
