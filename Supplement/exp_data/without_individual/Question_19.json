{"question": "A 420-page book contains an average of 600 words per page, and Roslyn reads the book at the rate of 360 words per minute. How many hours did it take her to read the book? Express your answer as a mixed number.", "answer": "This book contains $420\\times 600 = 252000$ words. Roslyn reads at 360 words per minute, so it takes her $\\frac{252000}{360} = 700$ minutes to read the book. To find how many hours it took her, we divide by 60: $\\frac{700}{60} = \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\n\nThe first step in solving this problem would be to determine the total number of words in the book. Since the book has 420 pages and each page contains approximately 600 words, we would multiply these two values to find the total.\n\nTotal number of words = number of pages X words per page\n\nSo, total number of words = 420 X 600 = 252,000 words.\n\nRound 2:\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many minutes it would take Roslyn to read the entire book. We already know that Roslyn reads at a rate of 360 words per minute. To find the number of minutes, we would divide the total number of words by her reading rate.\n\nReading time in minutes = total number of words / reading rate\n\nSo, reading time in minutes = 252,000 / 360 \u2248 700 minutes.\n\nRound 3:\n\nThe last step is to convert these minutes into hours, since the question asks for the answer in hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60 to get the equivalent in hours.\n\nReading time in hours = reading time in minutes / 60\n\nSo, reading time in hours = 700 / 60 = 11 40/60 hours\n\nFinally,\n\nWe can simplify 11 40/60 hours to 11 2/3 hours by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor which is 20.\n\nSo, the task is finished, and the result we obtain is \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}} hours.
