The other has sides of lengths $y, 15-3=12$ and a hypotenuse of length $e$.

If we can find the length of each segment, we can add them together to find the total length of rope.\n\nLet's start by focusing on the segment from one pole to where Paul is standing. If we draw a triangle formed by where Paul is standing, the top of the pole, and the base of the pole, we have a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 15 m (the rope height), a base of 5 m (the distance between Paul and the pole), and a height that is a remaining 12 m above Paul (because $15 - 3 = 12$).\n\nThe length of the rope in this segment is then the length of the hypotenuse calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem: $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

The base of the triangle is 5 m. The Pythagorean theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the sides of the triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. In this case, the sides would be 5 m and 12 m, and the hypotenuse is the length of the rope from one pole to where Paul is standing. This gives us $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169}$. So, the length of the rope on the left side of Paul is 13 m.\n\nFor the second triangle, the base is the distance from where Paul is standing to the other pole, which is 14 m - 5 m = 9 m.
