{"question": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?", "answer": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's let $W$ denote the number of matches the player won before the weekend began and $T$ denote the total number of matches she played before the weekend.

Therefore $(W+3)/(M+4) > 0.503$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $W$ into the announced inequality gives us $(.500M + 3)/(M+4) > 0.503$. Solve this inequality by multiplying all terms by ($M+4$) to eliminate the denominator yielding $0.500M + 3 > 0.503(M+4)$.\n\nSimplify the inequality by distributing on the right to get: $0.500M + 3 > 0.503M + 2.012$.\n  \nSubtract $0.500M$ from both sides to isolate the term with $M$ on one side: $3 - 2.012 > 0.003M$.\n\nNow solve the inequality for $M$: $M < (0.988)/0.003 = 329.33$.\n\nWe can't play a fraction of a match, so the maximum number of matches that could have occurred is $329$.

At the start of the weekend, the player's win ratio is 0.500, which gives us the equation W = 0.500T.\n\nDuring the weekend, the player plays 4 more matches, winning 3 and losing 1. This adds 4 to her total matches played and 3 to her total matches won. As a result, her new win ratio is greater than 0.503. The expressions for her new total matches played and total matches won gives us a new equation: (W+3)/(T+4) > 0.503.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the new equation to get: (0.500T + 3) / (T + 4) > 0.503. Simplifying this gives us the inequality: 0.003T > 0.988. Solving this for T, we get T < 329.33.\n\nSince the number of matches played has to be a whole number, the nearest whole number less than 329.33 is 329.

So, at the end of the weekend, she had won $W + 3$ matches in total and played $P + 4$ matches in total, leading to the win ratio $(W + 3) / (P + 4) > 0.503$.\n\nWe solve for $W$ in inequality (2): \n\n$W + 3 > 0.503(P + 4)$\n\nSubstitute $W$ from Equation (1) into the inequality. \n\n$0.500P + 3 > 0.503P + 2.012$\n\nRearrange to \n\n$0.003P > 0.988$\n\nAnd simplify to \n\n$P < \\frac{0.988}{0.003}$.\n\nCalculating the right hand side gives $P<329.333$.
