What they've found doesn't contradict any given conditions in the problem. They not only find the possible remainders when $a+b+c$ is divided by 13, but also provide a frequency table, concluding 8 appeared most frequently.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I find agent Solution 3 to be the most convincing. Thus, the remainder when $a+b+c$ is divided by $13$ would be $\\boxed{8}$.", "round 2": "Given the differing solutions presented, let's see if we can provide a clear and detailed resolution to the given problem.\n\nAs observed from every agent's reasoning, the idea of setting $a = b = c$ keeps coming up. This is simply because of the symmetry in each of the given congruences. Hence, we should try if letting $a = b = c$ would lead us to a valid solution. This simplifies the equations as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4a^2 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{13} \\text{ }\\\\\n4a^2 &\\equiv 6a^3\\pmod{13}  \\\\\n4a^2 &\\equiv 8a^3\\pmod{13}  \n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, since $a$ is a non-zero positive integer:\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{13} \\\\\na^2 &\\equiv 3a\\pmod{13} \\\\\na^2 &\\equiv 4a\\pmod{13} \n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving these quadratic congruences yields $a \\equiv 0, \\pm3, \\pm4 \\pmod{13}$. However, we know $a \\in (0, 12)$. Hence, the valid solutions within this range are $a = 3, 4$. If we want a solution in the domain $[1, 12]$, we need to consider that $3 \\equiv -10 \\pmod{13}$ and $4 \\equiv -9 \\pmod{13}$. \n\nThis gives us possible values for $a$ to be $3, 4, 10, 9$.\n\nAs we assumed $a = b = c$, it implies that, $a + b + c = 3 * a$ and on simplifying it further, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na = 3 \\implies a + b + c &= 9\\\\\na = 4 \\implies a + b + c &= 12\\\\\na = 10 \\implies a + b + c &= 30 \\implies 4 \\pmod{13}\\\\\na = 9 \\implies a + b + c &= 27 \\implies 1 \\pmod{13}\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence, by the exhaustive search in the domain of $a$ for the symmetry solution $a = b = c$, we find that the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by $13$ can be either \\boxed{9}, \\boxed{12}, \\boxed{4}, or \\boxed{1}.\n\nHowever, we must validate these solutions by testing them back in the original equations, to ensure there was no flawed reasoning or missed information when deriving the solutions.\n\nDoing so, we find that $a + b + c = 9$ and $a + b + c = 12$ indeed satisfy the conditions specified in the problem. But for $a + b + c = 4$ or $a + b + c = 1$, they do not hold true when we consider the initial congruence equations.\n\nFinally, by taking into account the given constraints and the theorem, we can conclude that the only valid remainders when $a+b+c$ is divided by $13$ are \\boxed{9} or \\boxed{12}. Therefore, we agree with the solution of Agent 0."}]}
