This type of function is known as a recursive function, where the value of a certain term is determined by the values of some previous terms.\n\nRound 2: Finding the function\n\nThe first thing we can do is to use the given conditions $f(15)=20$ and $f(20)=15$ and start calculating the function backwards and forwards to see if we can establish a pattern or get a closer idea about the function. Unfortunately, we get stuck pretty quickly as we don't have sufficient data points to find out the values of $f(x)$ at other points, as calculating $f(16)$ would require knowing $f(15)$ and $f(17)$, but we don't know $f(17)$.\n\nRound 3: Using the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe can think of $f(x)$ as a sequence $a_n$ where $n$ is an integer and the given relation is $a_n = a_{n+1} + a_{n-1}$, a form of recurrence relation. Now we can see if we can guess the function or sequence.\n\nRound 4: Pattern Discovery\n\nIf we look at the provided data points, we see a pattern: $f(20)=15$ and $f(15)=20$. It appears that the $f$ value merely swaps the input. So we test this theory by creating two equations:\n\n1. $f(16)=f(17)+f(15)=\\text{unknown}+20$\n2. $f(19)=f(20)+f(18)=15+\\text{unknown}$\n\nBut we get stuck here because we do not know the values of $f(17)$ and $f(18)$.\n\nRound 5: More Pattern Discovery\n\nIt's clear the first pattern didn't quite lead to a solution. But let's bring in the given function relation again: $f(x)=f(x+1)+f(x\u22121)$. We could rearrange it to: $f(x+1)=f(x)\u2212f(x\u22121)$, meaning that to get to the next term, we subtract the previous term from the current term. This gives us an interesting direction. Now we see a different pattern from the known values. Checking our theory by calculating $f(16)=f(15)-f(14)$, we find that $f(16)=20-f(14)$ and $f(19)=15-f(17)$. To go forward or backward, we would subtract a previous term.\n\nRound 6: Solving the given\n\nLet's go back to the unique values we have been given to start: $f(15)=20$ and $f(20)=15$. We can use our newly discovered pattern and the given: $f(20)=15=f(19)-f(18)=f(18)-f(17)=\\cdots=f(16)-f(15)=f(15)-f(14)=20-f(14)$. From here, we get that $f(14)=25$. Using this pattern again, we can incrementally find that $f(13)=15$, $f(12)=20$, and so forth. We see the numbers 15 and 20 are repeating after every 5 steps.

To determine the value of $f(x)$, we need to know the values of $f(x + 1)$ and $f(x - 1)$. This pattern forms the basis of our problem-solving method.\n\nStep 2: Study the Given Values\nWe are given that $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15$. If we observe, it appears that the function values $f(x)$ for $x = 15$ and $x = 20$ basically swaps the positions of 15 and 20.\n\nStep 3: Identify a Pattern\nSubtracting $f(x - 1)$ from both sides of the given recurrence relation, we can express it as $f(x + 1) = f(x) - f(x - 1)$. This new expression reveals the pattern that $f(x + 1)$ is computed by subtracting the last term $f(x - 1)$ from the current term $f(x)$.\n\nStep 4: Use the Pattern\nWe can use the given values of $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15$ and the pattern identified above to compute other values of the function. Notably, to verify if the function is periodic, and if so, the periodicity. \n\nStep 5: Deduce the Period\nBy repeating the pattern on the given data, we can see that the function repeats its value set {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}, and the difference of 5 forms the period of this pattern.\n\nStep 6: Get the Desired Value\nSince 20152015 modulo 5 equals $0$, $f(20152015)$ must be equal to $f(0)$. By tracing back in the sequence for $f(0)$, we find that it is the value 20. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $f(20152015) = \\boxed{20}$. This solution is consistent with most of the agents' solutions, and thoroughly refutes the incorrect solution from Agent 3, which failed to correctly identify the periodic pattern of the function."}]}
