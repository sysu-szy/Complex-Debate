Usually, one would show that the derivative of the function is positive to the right of the minimum and negative to the left of the minimum, to guarantee that the function is decreasing, then increasing, and therefore has a local minimum at that point. However, the expression given involves $a^3 b$ in the denominator, so the derivative would be undefined at $a=0$ or $b=0$; therefore, the positivity or negativity of the derivative in the neighborhood of $(a,b)=(0,0)$ provides insufficient information about the presence of an extremum.
