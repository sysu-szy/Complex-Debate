{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.

Because the total number of divisors is $(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1)(k_3 + 1)\u2026(k_i + 1)$, and $k+1$ represents the exponents which can be 0 to $k$.\n\nNow, we're given that the product of all these divisors is $n^6$. Hence, that means: $d_1 * d_2 * d_3...* d_i = n^6$. \n\nGiven the rule that the product of the divisors of n is $n^{d/2}$ where d denotes the total number of divisors, we have: $n^{d/2} = n^6$. This simplifies to $d = 12$.\n\nSo, for n to be as minimal as possible, we would like it to be the product of some small primes. Basically, we're trying to make the number of divisors equal to 12. We can do this by raising a prime number to the 11th power, or by multiplying a prime number raised to the 5th power by another different prime. The smallest such primes are 2 and 3, respectively. \n\nSo, the number n = $2^{11}$ = 2048 or n = $2^5 * 3^1$ = 96.

However, it's essential to note that this formula is derived under the condition that the divisors are ordered and multiplied in an appropriate way - namely, smallest to largest or paired in the fashion that they multiply to 'n'. \n\nWe are, however, not given that the divisors are being multiplied in any particular order in this problem. Therefore, accepting this formula without careful consideration leads to inconsistency and incorrect calculation of 'd', as Agents 0 and 1 misunderstood 'd' to be equal to 12 and 6 respectively. \n\nOn the other hand, Agent 2 and 3 correctly stated and applied the concept of the product of divisors related to the prime factorization of 'n', and deduced the correct quadratic equation leading to $a_i$ = 2.

Since 'd' is the number of divisors and must be a whole number, we rule out 13. We now have $d=12$.\n\nThe smallest way in which we can get 12 divisors, is to break it down in the following ways:\n1. $11 + 1$; this would produce $n$ as a prime to the power of 11.\n2. $5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$; this would produce $n$ consisting of a prime to the power of 5 and six other unique prime numbers.\n\nHowever, the second way would lead to a big number as it uses seven unique prime powers, Therefore, let's stick to the first case.\n\nSo, trying the smallest prime to the power 11, we get $n=2^{11}=2048$.\n\nBut notice there's another potential way: $d=(a_1+1)(a_2+1) = 2 * 6 = 12$.

Trying the smallest primes for this case, we get $n = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 900$.\n\nHowever, as Agent 2 and Agent 3 have pointed out, there's an even smaller possibility.

The smallest possiblity for 'n' in this case is $n = 2^3 * 3 = 24$.\n\nWait! While this conversation has been enlightening and we dived into some interesting cases, we missed a crucial, much simpler way to get 12: $d = (a_1+1)(a_2+1) = 6 * 2 = 12$. This corresponds to two distinct primes, both raised to the power of 2.
