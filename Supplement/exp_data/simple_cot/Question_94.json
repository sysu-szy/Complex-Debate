{"question": "A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?", "answer": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began. After the weekend, she would have won $n+3$ games out of $2n+4$ total. Therefore, her win ratio would be $(n+3)/(2n+4).$ This means that \\[\\frac{n+3}{2n+4} > .503 = \\frac{503}{1000}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get $1000(n+3) > 503(2n+4),$ which is equivalent to $n < \\frac{988}{6} = 164.\\overline{6}.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is $\\boxed{164}.$", "agents_response": "The win ratio of the tennis player before the weekend is .500. Hence if \"w\" represents the matches won by the player before the weekend and \"t\" the total matches played before the weekend, the ratio w/t = 0.500. This simplifies to w = 0.5t.\n\nNow, let's consider the ratio after the player plays four more matches over the weekend, winning three. The new number of matches won and the total matches played are now (w+3) and (t+4) respectively.\n\nThe problem states that her win ratio after these additional matches is greater than .503. This translates to the inequality (w+3)/(t+4) > 0.503.\n\nIf we substitute the previous mandate of w = 0.5t in this inequality, we have (0.5t+3)/(t+4) > 0.503, which simplifies to t < 1993.66 after cross-multiplication. Therefore, the maximum number of total games played before the weekend could be 1993.\n\nAccording to earlier relationship w = 0.5t, the maximum number of games won before the weekend could be 0.5 * 1993 = 996.5. But since one can't win a fraction of a match, the real maximum number of games won has to be less than 997...\n\nSo therefore, the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began is \\boxed{996}."}
