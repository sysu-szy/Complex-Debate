{"question": "A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 40$), then the number of books sold per month is $120-3p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?", "answer": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or\n\\[p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.\\]We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-3(p-20)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=20$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book.", "agents_response": "Let's solve this problem by using the concept of revenue.\n\nRevenue is calculated by multiplying the number of units sold by the price per unit. In this case, the bookstore's revenue (R) can be represented as:\n\nR = p(120 - 3p)\n\nWe have to maximize this revenue for p \u2264 40.\n\nWe can figure out the maximum value by calculating its derivative and setting it equal to zero. By doing so, we find the value of p at the maximum.\n\nExpand the equation R: \n\nR = 120p - 3p^2\n\nThe derivative of R with respect to p (dR/dp) is:\n\ndR/dp = 120 - 6p\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero to find the critical values:\n\n0 = 120 - 6p\n\nSolve for p:\n\n6p = 120\n\np = 120/6 = \\boxed{20}\n\nCheck the sign of the second derivative of this function to ensure it's a maximum:\n\nThe second derivative of R with respect to p (d^2R/dp^2) is:\n\nd^2R/dp^2 = -6\n\nSince -6 < 0, p = 20 is indeed a maximum and reveals the price the store should charge to maximize its revenue."}
