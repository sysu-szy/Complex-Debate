{"question": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?", "answer": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.", "agents_response": "In order for Billy to hit the bull's eye, the arrow must reach a height of 5 feet above the ground at time $t$. The equation for the height of the arrow thus becomes:\n\n$5 = 10 - 23t - 10t^2$\n\nRearranging terms in the equation:\n\n$10t^2 + 23t + 5 = 10$\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$10t^2 + 23t - 5 = 0$\n\nMultiplying through by 10 gives:\n\n$100t^2 + 230t - 50 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $at^2 + bt + c = 0$, and can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is $t = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a$,\n\nwhere $a = 100$, $b = 230$, and $c = -50$, we have:\n\n$t = [-230 \u00b1 sqrt((230)^2 - 4*100*(-50))] / (2 * 100)$\n$t = [-230 \u00b1 sqrt(52900 + 20000)] / 200$\n$t = [-230 \u00b1 sqrt(72900)] / 200$\n$t = [-230 \u00b1 270] / 200$\n\nNote that time cannot be negative, so we disregard the solution $t = (-230 - 270) / 200 = -2.5$.\n\nSo our possible solution is $t = (-230 + 270) / 200 = 0.2$. Thus \\boxed{0.2}."}
