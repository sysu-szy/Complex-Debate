{"question": "If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)", "answer": "First, we factor $10!:$\n\\begin{align*} 10!&=10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\\\ &=2^8\\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7.\\end{align*}\nHence, $x$ can be $1, 2^1, 2^2, 3, 2^1\\cdot 3,\\text{ or }2^2\\cdot 3$ for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ possible values of $x.$", "agents_response": "Step 1: It's important to note that $x$ is a positive factor of $10!$ and $x^3$. This means that $x$ must be some integer that divides into $10!$. \n\nStep 2: Factorize $10!$. We can write $10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n\nStep 3: Break down the factors into their prime factors as much as possible. We have\n$10! = 2^8 \\times 5^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 7$.\n\nStep 4: Since $x^3$ is a factor of $10!$, there are three possible cases we can consider for $x$:\n\nCase 1:  $x$ as a power of a single prime. \n\nIn this case, $x$ could be a cube of 2, 3 or 5. The exponent 8 of 2 in the prime factorization of $10!$ allows $x$ to take two possible values: $2^3$ and $2^6$. For 3 and 5, $x$ can only take a single value ($3^3$ and $5^1$). So there are a total of 2+1+1 = 4 possible values for $x$ in this case.\n\nCase 2: $x$ as a product of different primes.\n\nHere, we need to consider pairs of different primes. The only viable pair is (2, 5), and there are two options for $x$ : $2 \\times 5$ and $2^2 \\times 5$. So there are 2 possible values for $x$ in this case.\n\nCase 3: $x$ as a product of three different primes.\n\nThis isn't possible since there isn't enough '3' in the prime factorization to accommodate.\n\nStep 5: Put all cases together.\n\nIn total, there are 4 values from case 1, 2 values from case 2, and 0 values from case 3. So there are 4+2+0=6 possible integer values for $x$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{6}$."}
