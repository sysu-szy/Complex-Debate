{"question": "Our basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?", "answer": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.", "agents_response": "First, we calculate the number of ways to select 5 players from 10. This is calculated using the combination formula which is nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!] where \"!\" is the factorial symbol, n is the number of total items, and r is the number of items to choose. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. \n\nIn our case, we have n=10 and we want to choose r=5 players, so the calculation goes as follows: \n\n10C5 = 10! / [5!(10-5)!] = 252. \n\nSo there are 252 ways to select 5 players out of 10. \n\nHowever, once we have selected one team of 5 players, the players remaining for the other team are predetermined. So the count of all possible way to split 10 players into two teams of 5 is really just the count of ways to select one of the teams of 5. \n\nThus, the answer is 252. So, \\boxed{252}."}
