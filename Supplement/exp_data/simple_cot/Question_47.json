{"question": "Find the cubic polynomial, in $x,$ with integer coefficients that has $\\cos 20^\\circ$ as a root.  The coefficient of $x^3$ should be positive, and the coefficients should have no common factor other than 1.", "answer": "By the triple angle formula,\n\\[\\cos 3x = 4 \\cos^3 x - 3 \\cos x.\\]Setting $x = 20^\\circ,$ we get\n\\[\\cos 60^\\circ = 4 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 3 \\cos 20^\\circ,\\]so $4 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 3 \\cos 20^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2},$ or $8 \\cos^3 20^\\circ - 6 \\cos 20^\\circ - 1 = 0.$  Thus, $x = \\cos 20^\\circ$ is a root of $\\boxed{8x^3 - 6x - 1}.$", "agents_response": "The cube roots of unity are the roots of the equation $z^3 - 1 = 0.$  These roots are 1, $\\operatorname{cis} 120^\\circ,$ and $\\operatorname{cis} 240^\\circ.$\n\nSo let $x$ be a root of $\\cos 20^\\circ.$  Note that $\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos 240^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2},$ so $x = 2 \\cos 20^\\circ$ and $-x$ are also roots of the polynomial we seek.  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 0, so $x + (2 \\cos 20^\\circ) + (-x) = 0,$ which gives us $x = -\\cos 20^\\circ.$\n\nThen\n\\[x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 = (-\\cos 20^\\circ)^3 - (-\\cos 20^\\circ)^2 + (-\\cos 20^\\circ) - 1 = 0\\]by the triple angle formula for cosine.\n\nThus, the polynomial must be a constant multiple of $x^3 - x^2 + x - 1.$  Cubing an imaginary root of $x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 = 0$ will give us a real number, but the imaginary roots of this cubic are also cube roots of unity, so the leading coefficient must be positive, which means the polynomial we seek is $\\boxed{x^3 - x^2 + x - 1}.$"}
