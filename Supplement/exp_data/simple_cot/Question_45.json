{"question": "Find all real $x \\in [0, 2 \\pi]$ such that\n\\[\\tan 7x - \\sin 6x = \\cos 4x - \\cot 7x.\\]Enter all the real solutions, separated by commas.", "answer": "Writing everything in terms of sine and cosine and rearranging, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sin 7x}{\\cos 7x} - \\sin 6x &= \\cos 4x - \\frac{\\cos 7x}{\\sin 7x} \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\sin 7x}{\\cos 7x} + \\frac{\\cos 7x}{\\sin 7x} &= \\cos 4x + \\sin 6x \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\sin^2 7x + \\cos^2 7x}{\\sin 7x \\cos 7x} &= \\cos 4x + \\sin 6x \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{\\sin 7x \\cos 7x} &= \\cos 4x + \\sin 6x \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{2}{\\sin 14x} &= \\cos 4x + \\sin 6x \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\quad 2 &= \\sin 14x (\\cos 4x + \\sin 6x).\n\\end{align*}Since the range of sine and cosine are $[-1,1]$, $|\\sin 14x| \\le 1$ and $|\\cos 4x + \\sin 6x| \\le 2$ for all $x$.  Since the product of these two expressions is 2, they must all attain the maximum value.  That is, $|\\sin 14x| = 1$, $|\\sin 6x| = 1$, and $\\cos 4x = \\sin 6x$.  There are two cases:\n\nCase 1: If $\\sin 14x = -1$, then $\\cos 4x = \\sin 6x = -1$.  So $4x = k \\pi$, where $k$ is an odd integer.  Then for $x$ between 0 and $2\\pi$, we have $x = \\frac{\\pi}{4},$ $\\frac{3\\pi}{4},$ $\\frac{5\\pi}{4},$ $\\frac{7\\pi}{4}.$  It is not difficult to verify that only $x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and $x = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$ satisfy the other two equations.\n\nCase 2: If $\\sin 14x = 1$, then $\\cos 4x = \\sin 6x = 1$.  So $4x = k \\pi$, where $k$ is an even integer.  For $x$ between 0 and $2\\pi$, we have $x = 0,$ $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $\\pi,$ $\\frac{3\\pi}{2},$ $2 \\pi.$  Note that for all four possible values of $x$, $6x$ is a multiple of $\\pi$, and $\\sin 6x = 0$.  Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions of $x$ between 0 and $2\\pi$ are $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$ and $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\pi}{4}}$.", "agents_response": "We first get rid of the cotangent function by replacing it with 1/tan.\n\nThis transforms the equation to:\n\ntan(7x) - sin(6x) = cos(4x) - 1/(tan(7x)) \n\nWe multiply both sides by tan(7x) to clear the fraction. Now the equation becomes:\n\ntan^2(7x) - tan(7x)sin(6x) = cos(4x)tan(7x) - 1\n\nWe observe that we can express tan(7x) and cos(4x) in terms of sin(7x) and cos(7x). Let's use the following relationships:\n\nTan(7x) = sin(7x)/ cos(7x)\nCos(4x) = cos^2(2x) - sin^2(2x)\nCos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)\n\nPlugging these relationships into the equation reduces the problem to a relationship involving only sin(7x) and cos(7x). \n\nThe resulting equation is the following:\n\n(sin^2(7x) / cos^2(7x)) - (sin(7x)sin(6x) / cos(7x)) = (cos^4(x) - sin^4(x))(sin(7x) / cos(7x)) - 1\n\nNote that one solution is when sin(7x) = 0 and cos(7x) != 0, which simplifies the equation to -1 = -1, a true statement. This means that the solutions of sin(7x) = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi] are certainly solutions of the original equation. Do notice that x=0 is not a solution since cos(7*0)=1 but 1/0 is undefined.\n\nThe roots of sin(7x) = 0 in the interval are x=pi/7, 2pi/7, 3pi/7, 4pi/7, 5pi/7, 6pi/7, pi, 8pi/7, 9pi/7, 10pi/7, 11pi/7, 12pi/7, 13pi/7, 2pi.\n\nNow we need to find solutions that satisfy the equation when sin(7x) != 0 and cos(7x) != 0. These occur when we have (sin(7x)sin(6x) - cos^4(x) + sin^4(x)) / cos(7x) = 1.\n\nHowever, when we simplify the equation further, we find that it becomes equivalent to the equation sin(6x) - cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1, which simplifies to the equation -2cos^2(x) + 2sin^2(x) = 0 (when dividing by 2).\n\nThis can be further simplified to 2sin^2(x) - 2cos^2(x) = 0 or sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0.\n\nNote that for real x, the only solutions to sin^2(x) - cos^2(x) = 0 are when sin(x) = cos(x), or, in the first quadrant, x = pi/4 + n*2pi (with n an integer).\n\nHowever, none of these x are in the original interval where sin(7x) and cos(7x) are both nonzero. Therefore, we have found all the solutions, and they are the roots of sin(7x) = 0 in the interval [0, 2pi].\n\nThese solutions are:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{7}, \\frac{2\\pi}{7}, \\frac{3\\pi}{7}, \\frac{4\\pi}{7}, \\frac{5\\pi}{7}, \\frac{6\\pi}{7}, \\pi, \\frac{8\\pi}{7}, \\frac{9\\pi}{7}, \\frac{10\\pi}{7}, \\frac{11\\pi}{7}, \\frac{12\\pi}{7}, \\frac{13\\pi}{7}, 2\\pi}.\\]"}
