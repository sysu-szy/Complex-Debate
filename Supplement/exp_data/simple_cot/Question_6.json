{"question": "Let $f(x)$ be a function such that for all $x,$ $f(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x - 1).$  Given that $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15,$ compute $f(20152015).$", "answer": "Let $a = f(1)$ and $b = f(2).$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(3) &= f(2) - f(1) = b - a, \\\\\nf(4) &= f(3) - f(2) = (b - a) - b = -a, \\\\\nf(5) &= f(4) - f(3) = -a - (b - a) = -b, \\\\\nf(6) &= f(5) - f(4) = -b - (-a) = a - b, \\\\\nf(7) &= f(6) - f(5) = (a - b) - (-b) = a, \\\\\nf(8) &= f(7) - f(6) = a - (a - b) = b.\n\\end{align*}Since $f(7) = f(1)$ and $f(8) = f(2),$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the function becomes periodic from here on, with a period of length 6.\n\nThen $f(3) = f(15) = 20$ and $f(2) = f(20) = 15,$ and\n\\[f(20152015) = f(1) = f(2) - f(3) = 15 - 20 = \\boxed{-5}.\\]", "agents_response": "Let's try solving this problem step by step.\n\nLet's denote by $g(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)$. Then the given condition $f(x) = f(x+1)+f(x-1)$ can be reformulated as $g(x+1)=-g(x)$, where $g(20) = f(21)-f(20)= \\-(f(20)-f(19))=-g(19)$. \n\nFor any integer number, we can simply find the value of $g(x)$ by repeating this loop $g(x+1) = -g(x)$, where we know the value of $g(19)$. \n\nSo using this loop, we see that $g(x)$ has a period of 2, with values cycling between $-g(19)$ and $g(20)$. \n\nTo find the value of $f(20152015)$, we want to travel from some known value of $f(x)$ to $f(20152015)$ using the function $g(x)$.\n\nWe can use the value $f(15) = 20$ and mathematically travel to $f(20152015)$ by adding $g(x)$ exactly $20152015 - 15 = 20152000$ times. \n\nSince $g(x)$ has a period of 2, it is straightforward to see that after adding $20152000$ times $g(x)$, the function returns to $g(15)$. \n\nTherefore, $f(20152015) = f(15)=20$. \n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$."}
