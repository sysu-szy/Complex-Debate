{"question": "Let $O$ be the origin, and let $OABC$ be a rectangle, where $A$ and $C$ lie on the parabola $y = x^2.$  Then vertex $B$ must lie on a fixed parabola.  Enter the equation of the fixed parabola in the form \"$y = px^2 + qx + r$\".", "answer": "Let $A = (a,a^2)$ and $C = (c,c^2).$  Since $\\overline{OA}$ and $\\overline{OC}$ are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is $-1$:\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{a} \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{c} = -1.\\]Thus, $ac = -1.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\npair A, B, C, O;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = (0.8,func(0.8));\nC = (-1/0.8,func(-1/0.8));\nB = A + C - O;\n\ndraw(graph(func,-1.6,1.6));\ndraw(O--A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndot(\"$A = (a,a^2)$\", A, SE);\ndot(\"$B$\", B, N);\ndot(\"$C = (c,c^2)$\", C, SW);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nAs a rectangle, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide.  The midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is\n\\[\\left( \\frac{a + c}{2}, \\frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} \\right),\\]so $B = (a + c,a^2 + c^2).$\n\nLet $x = a + c$ and $y = a^2 + c^2.$  We want a relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the form of $y = px^2 + qx + r.$  We have that\n\\[x^2 = (a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2 = y - 2,\\]so the fixed parabola is $\\boxed{y = x^2 + 2}.$", "agents_response": "Solution: \nLet's assume the coodinates of A and C as (x, x\u00b2). Since ABCO is a rectangle and O is at the origin, the coordinates of B will be exactly the negative of the origin (0, 0), which means B will be (-x, -x\u00b2).\n\nSince A and C lie on two different quadrants (II and I respectively), we can say that the coordinates of A = (-x, x\u00b2) and C = (x, x\u00b2).\n\nAnd if you take a look at the rectangle, you can see that the B is a reflection of A along the Y-Axis, therefore B = (-x, -x\u00b2).\n\nThe given equation for points on A (and C) is y = x\u00b2, the equation to find the position of B (which is a reflection of A along the Y-Axis) will be a reflection of this equation. \n\nThis reflection can be obtained just by replacing 'x' with '-x'. Thus, to get to the equation of B, we simply replace x in A's equation with -x, which gives us:\n\ny = (-x)\u00b2 = x\u00b2.\n\nSo, the location of vertex B will also be on the original parabola y = x\u00b2\n\nHence, \\boxed{y = x^2} is the equation for the fixed parabola that vertex B lies on."}
