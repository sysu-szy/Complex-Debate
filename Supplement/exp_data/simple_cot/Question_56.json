{"question": "Three mutually tangent spheres of radius 1 rest on a horizontal plane.  A sphere of radius 2 rests on them.  What is the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere?", "answer": "Let $A,B,C$ and $E$ be  the centers of the three small spheres and the large sphere, respectively. Then $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral with side length 2. If $D$ is the intersection of the medians of $\\triangle ABC$, then $E$ is directly above $D$. Because $AE=3$ and $AD=2\\sqrt{3}/3$, it follows that \\[\nDE= \\sqrt{3^{2}-\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}}= \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3}.\n\\]Because $D$ is 1 unit above the plane and the top of the larger sphere is 2 units above $E$, the distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is \\[\n\\boxed{3+ \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3}}.\n\\][asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(10,0);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(5,8.7);\nD=(5,2.9);\ndraw(Circle(A,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle(B,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle(C,5),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--D--B,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(D--A,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(7.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(10,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(5,8.7),N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(3,4),S);\n[/asy]", "agents_response": "The three spheres of radius 1 touching each other form an equilateral triangle when viewing from the top. The largest sphere sits on top of them is touching each of them at a point. It would form a tetrahedron. \n\nIn order to find the distance from the plane, it would be helpful to find the height of that tetrahedron first. \n\nThe edge length of the tetrahedron is 2, because it is the diameter of the smaller spheres.\n\nWe can find the height of the tetrahedron by using Pythagoras' theorem.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the height is \u221a3/2 times the side length:\n\nh = (\u221a3/2) * 2 = \u221a3\n\nBut this height is from the center of the small spheres to the center of the large sphere. The distance from the plane to the center of the little spheres is their radius, which is 1. The distance from the center of the large sphere to its top is its radius, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the total distance from the plane to the top of the larger sphere is:\n\n1 (radius of small sphere) + \u221a3 (height of tetrahedron) + 2 (radius of large sphere) = 1 + \u221a3 + 2 = \u221a3 + 3.\n\nThe final solution in a box is \\boxed{\u221a3 + 3}."}
