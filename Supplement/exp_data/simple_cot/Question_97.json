{"question": "Paula invests $\\$10,\\!000$ at the start of a 5 year period at an interest rate of $10\\%$. At the end of those 5 years, how much is her investment worth if the interest is compounded quarterly?  Express your answer rounded to the nearest cent.", "answer": "In the first quarter, Paula earns $\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000)$ in interest, so her investment is worth $\\$10,\\!000 +\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000) = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)(\\$10,\\!000)$. Similarly, the value of her investment is multiplied by $1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}$ each quarter, so after 5 years, which is $5\\cdot 4 = 20$ quarters, her investment is worth \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{5\\cdot 4}(\\$10,\\!000) \\approx \\boxed{\\$16,\\!386.16}.\\]", "agents_response": "Answer:\n\nStep 1: Identify the variables you need.\n\nThe principal amount, P = $10,000 \nThe annual interest rate, r = 10% or 0.1 \nThe number of times interest is compounded per year, n = 4 (quarterly) \nThe number of years, t = 5\n\nStep 2: Plugging these values into the compound interest formula. \n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.1/4)^(4 * 5) \n\nStep 3: Simplify inside the brackets.\n\nA = 10000(1 + 0.025)^(20) \n\nStep 4: Simplify inside the brackets again.\n\nA = 10000(1.025)^(20) \n\nStep 5: Compute (1.025)^(20) \n\nA = 10000 * 1.64361946328\n\nStep 6: Multiply 10000 by 1.64361946328\n\nA = $16,436.19\n\nSo, Paula's investment will be worth approximately \\boxed{$16,436.19} at the end of 5 years."}
