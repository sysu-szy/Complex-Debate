{"question": "Let\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{-px - 3}{-qx + 3},\\]and let $g(x)$ be the inverse of $f(x).$  If $(7,-22)$ lies on both of the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x),$ then find $p + q.$", "answer": "If $(7,-22)$ lies on both $y = f(x)$ and the graph of its inverse, then $f(7) = -22$ and $f(-22) = 7.$  Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3} &= -22, \\\\\n\\frac{22p - 3}{22q + 3} &= 7.\n\\end{align*}Then $-7p - 3 = -22(-7q + 3) = 154q - 66$ and $22p - 3 = 7(22q + 3) = 154q + 21.$\nSolving, we find $p = 3$ and $q = \\frac{3}{11},$ so $p + q = 3 + \\frac{3}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{36}{11}}.$", "agents_response": "Step 1: Since the point $(7, -22)$ lies on the graph $y = f(x)$, we can substitute $x = 7$ and $y = -22$ into the equation of $f(x)$ to get: \n\n$-22 = \\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3}$ \n\nThis equation can be rewritten as: \n\n$-22(-7q + 3) = -7p - 3$ \n\nor $154q - 66 = 7p + 3$ \n\nor $7p= 154q - 69$  (equation 1)\n\nStep 2: Since the point $(7, -22)$ also lies on the graph $y = g(x)$, which is the inverse of the graph $y = f(x)$, we have $x = f(-22)$ \n\nSubstituting $x = 7$ and $y = -22$ into the equation of $f(x)$ yields:\n\n$7 = \\frac{22p - 3}{22q + 3}$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$7(22q + 3) = 22p - 3$\n\nor $154q + 21 = 22p - 3$\n\nor $22p = 154q + 24$ (equation 2)\n\nStep 3: Setting equation 1 equal to equation 2, we get:\n\n$154q + 24 = 154q - 69$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$93 = 0$\n\nThis is a contradiction, indicating that no such p and q exist.
