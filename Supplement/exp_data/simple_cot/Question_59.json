{"question": "Emma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?", "answer": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles.", "agents_response": "First, it is important to know that the number of ways a single rectangle can be arranged is determined by the number of factors that a given number has. \n\nIf Emma can make exactly ten different rectangular figures using all of her tiles, this indicates that the total number of tiles she has is a number with ten factors. \n\nUnderstanding this, we have to find the smallest number with ten factors. \n\nLet's look at the number of divisors a number has through prime factorization. If a number a has a prime factorization of the form a = p1^n1 * p2^n2 * ..., where p1, p2,... are distinct primes, then the total number of divisors d is given by d = (n1+1) * (n2+1) * ....  \n\nThe number 2^9 has ten factors \u2013 it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. However, this is not the smallest number with ten factors; its value is 512. \n\nInstead, if we consider the number 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^1, its prime factorization indicates that it has (1+1) * (2+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 factors, more than we need. \n\nBut if we remove the power of 2 (since 2^1 is obviously smaller than 2^9), the number becomes 3^2 * 5^1, which has (2+1) * (1+1) = 3 * 2 = 6 factors. This is still more than we need.\n\nSo, let's reduce the power of 3. Then, the number becomes 3^1 * 5^1, which has (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 = 4 factors - which is less than we need.\n\nIf we change the power of 5 to 2 (which results in the number 3^1 * 5^2 = 75), the number of factors becomes (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 * 3 = 6, which is still less than we need.\n\nHowever, if we add back in the power of 2 (creating the number 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2 = 150), the number of factors becomes (1+1) * (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 * 2 * 3 = 12, which is more than we need.\n\nLet\u2019s lower the value of 2 to the second smallest prime, which is 3. So the lowest possible number with ten factors will be 3^1 * 3^1 * 5^2 = 225, which has (1+1) * (1+1) * (2+1) = 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 factors.\n\nAgain, this is more than we need, so the power of 5 should be reduced to 1. The smallest number with ten factors then becomes 3^1 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 45, which has (1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 factors.\n\nWe still have fewer factors than needed, so we substitute the first 3 to the lowest prime, which is 2. So the smallest number will be 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 30, which has (1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 factors, which is still less than we need.\n\nFinally, if we replace the second 3 by the fourth smallest prime, which is 7, the smallest number will be 2^1 * 7^1 * 5^1 = 70. This has (1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 factors, the same as before.\n\nHence, the smallest number with exactly ten factors is 70^2 = 4900.\n\nSo the least number of tiles Emma could have is \\boxed{4900}."}
