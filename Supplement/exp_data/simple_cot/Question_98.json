{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the initial error in the measurement of position as \u0394x, and the initial error in the measurement of momentum as \u0394p. According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we have that \u0394x*\u0394p \u2265 h/(4\u03c0), where h is Planck's constant.\n\nNow, if the error in the momentum is halved, we would have \u0394p/2. We want to find the new minimum error in that case, so let's denote it as \u0394x'. Then, we would have \u0394x'*(\u0394p/2) \u2265 h/(4\u03c0). \n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we have \u0394x'*\u0394p \u2265 h/(2\u03c0). This means that the new error \u0394x' would have to be at least twice as much as the original measurement \u0394x in order to satisfy the Uncertainty Principle.\n\nSo, the measurement error of the object's position increased by 100%, or doubled. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{100}."}
