{"question": "Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial such that\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x\\]for all real numbers $x.$  Find the sum of all possible values of $P(10).$", "answer": "Let $d$ be the degree of $P(x).$  Then the degree of $P(P(x))$ is $d^2.$  Hence, the degree of $P(P(x)) + P(x)$ is $d^2,$ and the degree of $6x$ is 1, so we must have $d = 1.$\n\nAccordingly, let $P(x) = ax + b.$  Then\n\\[a(ax + b) + b + ax + b = 6x.\\]Expanding, we get $(a^2 + a) x + ab + 2b = 6x.$  Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + a &= 6, \\\\\nab + 2b &= 0.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $a^2 + a - 6 = 0,$ which factors as $(a - 2)(a + 3) = 0,$ so $a = 2$ or $a = -3.$\n\nFrom the second equation, $(a + 2) b = 0.$  Since $a$ cannot be $-2,$ $b = 0.$\n\nHence, $P(x) = 2x$ or $P(x) = -3x,$ and the sum of all possible values of $P(10)$ is $20 + (-30) = \\boxed{-10}.$", "agents_response": "Step 1: Substituting x = 0\n\nLet's first substitute x = 0 into the provided equation:\n\n\\[P(P(0)) + P(0) = 6 * 0\\]\n\nThis simplifies to: \n\n\\[P(P(0)) + P(0) = 0\\]\n\nWe can also write it as:\n\n\\[P(P(0)) = -P(0)\\].\n\nStep 2: Substituting x = P(0)\n\nNext, let's substitute x = P(0) into the provided equation:\n\n\\[P(P(P(0))) + P(P(0)) = 6 * P(0)\\]\n\nSubstituting the result from Step 1, we get:\n\n\\[P(-P(0)) + -P(0) = 6 * P(0)\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[P(-P(0)) = 7 * P(0)\\].\n\nStep 3: Considering P(x) = ax\n\nThe structure of our resulting equations suggests that a likely candidate for P(x) is a linear polynomial. So, we'll assume that P(x) = ax. Substituting our conjecture into the given equation:\n\n\\[a^2x + ax = 6x\\]\n\nDividing through by x gives:\n\n\\[a^2 + a = 6\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[a^2 + a - 6 = 0\\].\n\nThis quadratic equation has roots a = 2 or a = -3.\n\nStep 4: Checking our assumptions\n\nWe'll now check whether each of these possible values of a gives a polynomial P(x) that satisfies the given equation.\n\nIf a = 2, then P(x) = 2x, and\n\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = 2(2x) + 2x = 6x\\]\n\nwhich is the given equation, so a = 2 is a valid solution.\n\nIf a = -3, then P(x) = -3x, and\n\n\\[P(P(x)) + P(x) = -3(-3x) + -3x = 6x\\]\n\nwhich is also the given equation, so a = -3 is also a valid solution.\n\nStep 5: Finding the value of P(10)\n\nWith a = 2, P(10) = 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nWith a = -3, P(10) = -3 * 10 = -30.\n\nStep 6: Finding the sum of all possible values of P(10)\n\nThe question asks for the sum of all possible values of P(10), which is:\n\n20 + (-30) = -10\n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of P(10) is \\boxed{-10}."}
