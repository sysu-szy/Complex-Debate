{"question": "Eighty percent of the students in a class (group A) share $40\\%$ of the candy equally. The remaining $20\\%$ of the students (group B) share the other $60\\%$ of the candy equally. The ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A has to the amount of candy a student in group B has is equal to what common fraction?", "answer": "Suppose that there are $c$ pieces of candy total shared by $s$ students in the class. In group A, there are $.8 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.4 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.4c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.8s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $.5\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. In group B, there are $.2 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.6 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.6c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.2s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $3\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. The ratio between the pieces of candy per student in group A and that in group B is $\\frac{.5\\frac{c}{s}}{3\\frac{c}{s}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.", "agents_response": "Let's break this down with algebra instead of assuming specific numbers for the group size or total amount of candy.\n\nConsider initially the total candy is 1 (as we only care about proportions, this does not matter). \n\nAccording to the conditions, \n\nThe total candy Group A gets is $40\\%$ of 1, i.e. 0.4. And there are $80\\%$ of total students in Group A. Let's denote $n$ as the total number of students. So there are $0.8n$ students in Group A.\n\nThe amount of candy each student in Group A gets is $\\frac{{0.4}}{{0.8n}} = \\frac{{0.5}}{{n}}$.\n\nSimilarly, \n\nThe total candy Group B gets is $60\\%$ of 1, i.e. 0.6. And there are $20\\%$ of total students in Group B. So there are $0.2n$ students in Group B.\n\nThe amount of candy each student in group B gets is $\\frac{{0.6}}{{0.2n}} = \\frac{{3}}{{n}}$.\n\nSo, the ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A has to the amount of candy a student in group B has is\n\n\\[\\frac{{\\frac{{0.5}}{{n}}}}{{\\frac{{3}}{{n}}}} = \\frac{{0.5}}{{3}} = \\frac{{1}}{{6}}.\\] \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."}
