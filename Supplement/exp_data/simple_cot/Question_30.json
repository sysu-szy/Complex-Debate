{"question": "If $a,b,c$ are positive integers less than $13$ such that \\begin{align*}\n2ab+bc+ca&\\equiv 0\\pmod{13}\\\\\nab+2bc+ca&\\equiv 6abc\\pmod{13}\\\\\nab+bc+2ca&\\equiv 8abc\\pmod {13}\n\\end{align*}then determine the remainder when $a+b+c$ is divided by $13$.", "answer": "Since $13$ is a prime, each of $a,b,c$ is invertible modulo $13$. Let $a^{-1}=x, b^{-1}=y, c^{-1}=z$ in modulo $13$. Multiplying both sides of each congruence by $(abc)^{-1}$ yields \\begin{align*}\n2z+x+y&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{13},\\\\\nz+2x+y&\\equiv 6 \\pmod{13},\\\\\nz+x+2y&\\equiv 8 \\pmod {13}.\n\\end{align*}Adding all three together gives $4(x+y+z)\\equiv 14\\pmod {13}\\implies x+y+z\\equiv 10\\pmod {13}$. Subtracting this from each results in \\begin{align*}\nz\\equiv -10\\equiv 3&\\pmod{13},\\\\\nx\\equiv -4\\equiv 9&\\pmod{13},\\\\\ny\\equiv -2\\equiv 11&\\pmod {13}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a+b+c\\equiv x^{-1}+y^{-1}+z^{-1}\\equiv 9+3+6\\equiv 18\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod{13}$.", "agents_response": "The first step in this problem is to realize that we can add the three given mod equations together. This gives us:\n\\[4ab + 4bc + 4ca \\equiv 14abc \\pmod {13}\\]\nNow we can divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ab + bc + ca \\equiv \\tfrac{7}{2}abc \\pmod {13}\\]\nHowever, since we're working in modulo 13, we instead say:\n\\[ab + bc + ca \\equiv 7abc \\pmod {13}\\]\nWe can simplify this equation to:\n\\[ab + bc + ca - 7abc = k \\cdot 13\\]\nWe're given that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all less than $13$, so the maximum value of $ab + bc + ca$ is $12 * 12 * 3 = 432$, and the maximum value of $7abc$ is $7 * 12^3 = 12096$.\nOur equation now has three solutions:\n1. $k = 0$: This means $ab + bc + ca = 7abc$, which simplifies to $ab(c - 7) + bc(a - 7) + ca(b - 7) = 0$. There are no solutions for $a, b, c < 13$ in this case.\n2. $k = 1$: This means $ab + bc + ca = 7abc + 13$. This simplifies to $ab(c - 7) + bc(a - 7) + ca(b - 7) = 13$. There are no solutions for $a, b, c < 13$ in this case either.\n3. $k = -1$: This means $ab + bc + ca = 7abc - 13$. This simplifies to $ab(c - 7) + bc(a - 7) + ca(b - 7) = -13$. In this case, the only positive solutions for $a, b, c < 13$ are $(a, b, c) = (1, 8, 6)$.\nThe remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by $13$ is therefore $\\boxed{2}$."}
