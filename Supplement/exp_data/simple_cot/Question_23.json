{"question": "Jane has been growing two bacteria farms.\n\nBacteria farm Rod has a starting population of 2 bacteria, while Bacteria farm Sphere has a starting population of 8 bacteria.  However, Jane starts growing Rod five hours before she starts growing Sphere.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Jane checks her farms and finds that they have the exact same population. If the population of Rod doubles every hour, but the population of Sphere is quadrupled every hour, how many hours ago did she start growing Sphere?", "answer": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$.", "agents_response": "The question is asking for the number of hours Jane started growing the Sphere bacterial farm after she had started growing the Rod bacterial farm. Given that both populations are the same at 8 p.m., we can write an equation to represent the growth of each farm. Since the population of Rod doubles every hour, if Jane had been growing it for x hours, it would be 2^x. Similarly, the population of Sphere which quadruples every hour, and had been growing for (x - 5) hours, would be 8*4^(x - 5).\n\nSince both populations are equal, we can write the equation:\n\n2^x = 8*4^(x - 5),\n\nwhere x is the number of hours Jane started growing Rod before 8 p.m.\n\nSolving this equation should yield the answer.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2^x, we get:\n\n1 = 4*(2^(x - 5))\n\nSolving for x we get:\n\n1 = 4*(2^(-5)) \n\nTherefore, x = 10 hours. \n\nBut the question asks how many hours ago she started growing Sphere, that will be x - 5 which is 10 - 5 = 5 hours. Hence, Jane started growing Sphere 5 hours before 8 p.m.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{5}."}
