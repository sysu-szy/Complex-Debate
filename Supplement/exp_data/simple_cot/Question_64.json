{"question": "A standard six-sided die was rolled 50 times, and the outcomes are shown in the table. What is the average of the 50 outcomes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nOutcome&$\\#$ of Occurrences\\\\\\hline\n1&14\\\\\\hline\n2&5\\\\\\hline\n3&9\\\\\\hline\n4&7\\\\\\hline\n5&7\\\\\\hline\n6&8\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}", "answer": "The total of the 50 outcomes is $(14 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 2) + (9 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 4) + (7 \\times 5) + (8 \\times 6) = 14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162.$ Dividing this by 50, we find that the average roll was $\\boxed{3.24}$.", "agents_response": "First, multiply each possible outcome by the number of times it occurred to find the sum of all outcomes:\n\n1 * 14 = 14\n2 * 5 = 10\n3 * 9 = 27\n4 * 7 = 28\n5 * 7 = 35\n6 * 8 = 48\n\nThen, add these products together to find the total sum of the outcomes: \n\n14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162\n\nNext, divide this sum by the total number of outcomes, which is 50, to find the average of all outcomes:\n\n162 / 50 = 3.24\n\nTherefore, the average of the 50 outcomes is \\boxed{3.24}."}
