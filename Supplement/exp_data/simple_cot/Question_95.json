{"question": "Define $f(x)=\\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ and $g(x)=\\frac{-2}{x+1}$. Find the value of \\[g(f(g(f(\\dotsb g(f(12)) \\dotsb ))))\\]where the function $f$ is applied 8 times, and the function $g$ is applied 8 times, alternating between the two.", "answer": "Define a new function $h(x)$ so that $h(x)=g(f(x))$. Then  \\begin{align*}\nh(x) &= g\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}+1}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-2}{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}+\\frac{1-x}{1-x}}=\\frac{-2}{\\frac{2}{1-x}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-1}{\\frac{1}{1-x}}=-(1-x)=x-1.\n\\end{align*}Thus our desired value is equivalent to $8$ compositions of the function $h(x)$. For each composition we subtract $1$ from the input value, so for $8$ compositions we subtract a total of $8$ from the input value, which is $12$. So our answer is $12-8=\\boxed{4}$.", "agents_response": "Let's resolve the expression step by step:\n\nFirst, we define the initial condition $x_0 = 12$.\n\nThen, we calculate the first iteration of the sequence, applying the function $f$:\n\n$f(x_0) = f(12) = \\frac{1+12}{1-12} = -\\frac{13}{11}$.\n\nLet's call this result $x_1$, so $x_1 = -\\frac{13}{11}$.\n\nIn the second iteration, we apply the function $g$:\n\n$g(x_1) = g\\left(-\\frac{13}{11}\\right) = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11} +1} = -\\frac{2}{\\frac{-2}{11}} = 11$.\n\nSo, we have that $x_2 = 11$.\n\nIf we repeat the operations for a third time, we have:\n\n$f(x_2) = f(11) = \\frac{1+11}{1-11} = -1$.\n\nAnd if we denote $x_3 = -1$, then:\n\n$g(x_3) = g\\left(-1\\right) = \\frac{-2}{-1 +1} = -\\infty$.\n\nThis result shows an undefined operation (division by zero). However, we notice a pattern here between $x_0 = 12$, $x_2=11$ and our starting functions. Specifically, if we start with an integer x and apply f, we get $-\\frac{x+1}{1-x}$, and then by applying g, we get back to $x-1$. This repeats until we reach $x=1$, at which point applying f results in a division by zero error.\n\nSo to save calculations, we can just run through the 8 iterations. We drop 1 each time live to the observed pattern, so 12 - 8 = 4. \n\nOn the last 8th operation, we need to apply the function $f$. So $x_8 = f(4) = \\frac{5}{-3} = -\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nHence, the result is \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}."}
