{"question": "Find the sum of all integers that satisfy these conditions: \\[\n|x|+1>7\\text{ and }|x+1|\\le7.\n\\]", "answer": "First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.\n\nNext, we consider $|x+1| \\le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \\le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.\n\nThe only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\\boxed{-15}$.", "agents_response": "First, consider the absolute value inequality $|x|+1 > 7$. Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the absolute value, yielding $|x| > 6$. This inequality is satisfied by the set of all real numbers less than -6 and all real numbers greater than 6.\n\nNext, consider the absolute value inequality $|x+1| \\leq 7$. This is equivalent to $-7 \\leq x+1 \\leq 7$. Subtract 1 from all terms to isolate $x$ and get $-8 \\leq x \\leq 6$.\n\nIn order for an integer $x$ to satisfy both inequalities, it must belong to the interval $(-\\infty, -6] \\cup [6, \\infty)$ from the first inequality and the interval $[-8, 6]$ from the second inequality. The intersection of these intervals is $(-\\infty, -6] \\cap [-8, 6] = [-8, -6]$ and $[6, \\infty) \\cap [-8, 6] = [6, 6]$. \n\nTherefore, the integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8, -7, -6, 6$. \n\nThe sum of these integers is $(-8) + (-7) + (-6) + 6 = -15$.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{-15}."}
