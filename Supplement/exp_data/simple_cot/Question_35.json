{"question": "Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive divisors of $80.$ What is the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80?$", "answer": "The positive divisors of $80$ are $1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,40,80.$ As $80=2^4\\cdot 5$, the immediate possibilities for $ab$ that do not divide $80$ are $8\\cdot 4=16\\cdot 2=32$ and $5\\cdot 10=50.$ As $32<50,$ the smallest $ab$ not a divisor of $80$ is $\\boxed{32}.$", "agents_response": "The prime factorization of 80 is $2^4 \\cdot 5$. The distinct positive divisors of 80 are the positive integers that can be formed by taking a product of different combinations of these prime factors. Knowing this, we can start to find the smallest numbers $a$ and $b$ that will make $ab$ not a divisor of 80.\n\nIn general, for $ab$ to be a divisor of 80, $a$ and $b$ must \"share\" the prime factors of 80 such that their product has no more of any prime than 80 does itself. This means that $ab$ must not have more than four 2's or one 5 in its prime factorization in order to divide 80.\n\nIf we start by letting $a=2^2=4$ and $b=2^2=4$, their product $ab=16$ is a divisor of 80 because it has exactly four 2s and no 5s in its prime factorization. However, if we let $a=2^3=8$ and $b=2=2$, then $ab=16$ again and is still a divisor of 80.\n\nIf we let $a=2^2=4$ and $b=5$, then $ab=2^2*5=20$ is a divisor of 80, satisfying the condition that $ab$ must not have more than four 2's or one 5. So we need to find other $a$ and $b$ combinations.\n\nTo find a smaller product, we should incorporate the 5 in one of these divisors. So if we let $a=2$ (which is smaller than 4) and $b=2^2*5=20$, then $ab=2*20=40$ which is a divisor of 80.\n\nTo get a product larger than 80, we can try to use more than four 2's or more than one 5. If we let $a=2^3=8$ and $b=2*5=10$, then $ab=8*10=80$ which is again a divisor of 80.\n\nIf we let $a=5$ and $b=2^3=8$ (switching the $a$ and $b$ from the previous case), then $ab=5*8=40$ which is again a divisor of 80.\n\nThus, in all cases where we have a combination of the divisors with $a$ not equal to $b$, the smallest product tends to be a divisor of 80. Therefore, to find a product that is not a divisor of 80, we will need to use a factor not present in the factorization of 80. \n\nIn this case, if we let $a=2$ and $b=2^2*5^2=100$, then $ab=2*100=200$, which is not a divisor of 80 because it consists of more than one 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of 80 is \\boxed{200}."}
