{"question": "An airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?", "answer": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$.", "agents_response": "This problem describes an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 100 feet. \n\nThe nth term of any arithmetic series can be described as a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 = the first term, d = the common difference, and n = the number of terms. \n\nHowever, we look for the sum of the series, not the nth term. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula, S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Setting S_n equal to the 12,000 feet that the airplane must climb, we get:\n\n12,000 feet = n/2 * ( 100 + (100 + (n - 1)*100)).\n\nSolving for n gives us: \n\n12,000 feet =  n/2 * ( 100 + (100n - 100)).\n\n12,000 feet = n/2 * (100n).\n\n24,000 feet = n^2 * 100.\n\nn^2 = 240.\n\nTaking the positive square root of both sides (since n, the number of seconds, must be positive in this context), we find that n = sqrt(240).\n\nHowever, the number of seconds must be a whole number so we need to round sqrt(240) to the next largest whole number. Therefore, \\boxed{16} seconds will ensure the plane is at least 12,000 feet high."}
