{"question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?", "answer": "Since the minimum position error and the momentum error are inversely proportional, halving one doubles the other, or increases it by $\\boxed{100\\%}$.", "agents_response": "Let's denote the error in the measurement of the particle's momentum as \u0394p, and the error in the measurement of the particle's position as \u0394x. According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, this relationship is given by:\n\n\u0394p*\u0394x \u2265 h/(4\u03c0)  [Equation 1]\n\nWhere h is the Planck constant.\n\nWhen the error in momentum \u0394p is halved, let's denote the new error as \u0394p'. Also, the corresponding error in position we will denote as \u0394x'. Therefore,\n\n\u0394p' = \u0394p/2\n\u0394p'*\u0394x' \u2265 h/(4\u03c0)  [Equation 2]\n\nSubstituting \u0394p' from the equation above into equation 2, we get:\n\n(\u0394p/2)*\u0394x' \u2265 h/(4\u03c0)\n\nSolving for \u0394x', we get:\n\n\u0394x' = (h/((\u0394p/2)*(4\u03c0)), which simplifies to: \n\n\u0394x' = 2*h/(\u0394p*4\u03c0) = 2*\u0394x\n\nTherefore, when the error in momentum is halved, the minimum error in the measurement of its position increases by a factor of 2 or 100 percent. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{100}."}
