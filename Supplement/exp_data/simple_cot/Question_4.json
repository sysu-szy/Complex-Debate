{"question": "A number is doubled, then decreased by $13.7$.  The result is greater than $125.28$. What is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition?", "answer": "Let $x$ be the desired integer. Then $2x-13.7>125.28$.  Adding $13.7$ to both sides gives $2x>138.98$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives $x>69.49$.  The smallest integer that is greater than $69.49$ is $\\boxed{70}$.", "agents_response": "Let's assume the number we are looking for is x.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number is doubled and then decreased by 13.7 to give a result greater than 125.28.\n\nSo, we can write the equation as, 2x - 13.7 > 125.28\n\nWe want to isolate x in this equation to find the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. \n\nAdd 13.7 to both sides:\n\n2x > 125.28 + 13.7 = 138.98\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx > 138.98 / 2 = 69.49\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 69.49 is 70. \n\nSo the smallest integer that satisfies this condition is \\boxed{70}."}
