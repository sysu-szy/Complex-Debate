{"question": "How many different positive integers divisible by 4 can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits? For example, 12 counts, but 512 does not.", "answer": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.", "agents_response": "First, we need to ascertain that a number is divisible by 4 when its last two digits form a number is divisible by 4. The numbers 12, 24, and 32 are divisible by 4 but 14, and 41, 13, 21, 23, and 34 are not.\n\nIf the number formed with the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 ends with 12, 24, or 32, it is divisible by 4. We can arrange the remaining two digits in 2 ways for each case (ie, there are 2! ways to arrange two digits). There are therefore 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 such numbers.\n\nIf the number formed with the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 ends with 4, it is also divisible by 4. Because we have 3 remaining digits, there are 3 possible choices for the digit that precedes the 4. This leaves 2 digits that can be arranged in 2! ways, so there are 3 \u00d7 2! = 6 such numbers.\n\nAdding these two cases gives 6 + 6 = 12 total numbers. So, in simple solution \\boxed{12}."}
