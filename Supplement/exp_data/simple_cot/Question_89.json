{"question": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, and that $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$.  Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $4$.", "answer": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 8, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 4 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^4$ or $b(g(x))^4$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^4$, which equals $ba_{n}^4x^{4n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 8, we have $4n=8$, so $n=2$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{2}$.", "agents_response": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in that polynomial. \n\nNow, to determine the degree of $g(x)$, we look at the function $h(x)$. \n\n$h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x)$ is composed of two parts - one is $f(g(x))$ and the other is $g(x)$. The degree of a polynomial results from the multiplication of powers, so the degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$. \n\nSince the degree of $h(x)$ is $8$ and $h(x)$ is the sum of $f(g(x))$ and $g(x)$, the degree of $g(x)$ is such that either $g(x)$ or $f(g(x))$ has the highest degree of $8$, so the degree of the other part cannot exceed $8$.  \n\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is $4$. If the degree of $g(x)$ would be $2$, then the degree of $f(g(x))$ would be $4 \\times 2 = 8$, which equals to the degree of $h(x)$. Also, with the degree of $2$, $g(x)$ would not exceed the degree of $h(x)$ which is $8$. \n\nTherefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is \\boxed{2}."}
