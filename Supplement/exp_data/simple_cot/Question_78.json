{"question": "If $n>1$ is an integer, the notation $a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}$ means that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $n$. Find the sum of all possible values of $n$ such that both of the following are true: $171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$ and $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$.", "answer": "As we are told, we want to find all values of $n>1$ such that $n$ divides into $171-80 = 91$ and $n$ also divides into $468 - 13 = 455$. We notice that $455 = 5 \\cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\\{1,7,13,91\\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = \\boxed{111}$.", "agents_response": "The two conditions can be re-written as follows: \n\n$171-80$ is a multiple of $n$, and $468-13$ is a multiple of $n$.\n\nSubtracting we get:\n\n$91$ is a multiple of $n$, and $455$ is a multiple of $n$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ must be a factor of both $91$ and $455$. The factors of $91$ are $1, 7, 13, 91$. The factors of $455$ are $1, 5, 7, 13, 35, 65, 91, 455$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $n$ are $1, 7, 13, 91$. \n\nThe sum of these values is $1+7+13+91=\\boxed{112}$."}
