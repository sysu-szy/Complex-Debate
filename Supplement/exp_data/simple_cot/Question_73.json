{"question": "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?\n\nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.", "answer": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.", "agents_response": "We'll start by determining the number of ways the first three cars can position themselves. Car 1 can go to any of the 3 lanes, car 2 can go to any of the remaining 2 lanes, and car 3 can only go to the 1 remaining lane. So, there are 3*2*1=6 ways the first three cars can position themselves.\n\nNow, let's look at the next 3 cars. Each of these cars can go to any of the 3 lanes, so there are 3 options for each of them. Therefore, there are 3*3*3 = 27 possible arrangements of these cars.\n\nTo find the total number of ways all 6 cars can stack up, we multiply these two results together.\n\nSo, \\boxed{6*27=162} ways is the total number of ways to stack up the cars.\n"}
