{"question": "Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be the hyperbola with foci at $(\\pm 5, 0)$ and vertices at $(\\pm 3, 0),$ and let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the circle with center $(0,0)$ and radius $4.$ Given that $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ intersect at four points, what is the area of the quadrilateral formed by the four points?", "answer": "For the hyperbola $\\mathcal{H},$ we have $a=3$ and $c=5,$ so $b= \\sqrt{c^2-a^2} = 4.$ Thus, the hyperbola has equation \\[\\frac{x^2}{3^2} - \\frac{y^2}{4^2} = 1,\\]or \\[16x^2 - 9y^2 = 144.\\]Meanwhile, the equation for the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 16.$ To find the points of intersection, we solve these two equations simultaneously. Adding $9$ times the second equation to the first equation gives $25x^2 = 288,$ so $x = \\pm \\frac{12\\sqrt2}{5}.$ Then we have \\[y^2 = 16 - x^2 = 16 - \\frac{288}{25} = \\frac{112}{25},\\]so $y = \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt7}{5}.$ Therefore, the four points of intersection form a rectangle with side lengths $\\frac{24\\sqrt2}{5}$ and $\\frac{8\\sqrt7}{5},$ so its area is $\\frac{24\\sqrt2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8\\sqrt7}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{192\\sqrt{14}}{25}}.$\n[asy]\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n\tdraw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\npath[] yh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real x0, real x1, bool upper=true, bool lower=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\treal f(real x) { return k + a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    real g(real x) { return k - a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    if (upper) { draw(graph(f, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    if (lower) { draw(graph(g, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    path [] arr = {graph(f, x0, x1), graph(g, x0, x1)};\n    return arr;\n}\nvoid xh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real y0, real y1, bool right=true, bool left=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\tpath [] arr = yh(a, b, k, h, y0, y1, false, false);\n    if (right) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[0],color,  Arrows);\n    if (left) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[1],color,  Arrows);\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n\tdraw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nsize(8cm);\naxes(-6,6,-6,6);\nxh(3,4,0,0,-5,5);\ne(4,4,0,0);\ndot((5,0)^^(-5,0)^^(3,0)^^(-3,0));\nfor (int i=-1; i<=1; i+=2)\n\tfor (int j=-1; j<=1; j+=2)\n    \tdot((i*12*sqrt(2)/5,j*4*sqrt(7)/5));\ndraw((-1*12*sqrt(2)/5,-1*4*sqrt(7)/5)--(12*sqrt(2)/5,-1*4*sqrt(7)/5)--(12*sqrt(2)/5,4*sqrt(7)/5)--(-12*sqrt(2)/5,4*sqrt(7)/5)--cycle,dotted);\n[/asy]", "agents_response": "First, it is necessary to derive the equation of the hyperbola and the circle.\n\nFor the hyperbola, the length of the major axis is the distance between foci, so 2a=10. Thus, a=5. The distance between vertices is 2b, so 2b=6, thus b=3. So the equation is (x^2)/(a^2) - (y^2)/(b^2) = 1 which simplifies to (x^2/25) - (y^2/9) = 1.\n\nFor the circle, the center at the origin and radius 4 implies the equation is x^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nThe four points of intersection are the solutions to these two equations. We can substitute the equation for the circle into the equation for the hyperbola to solve for y. Doing so gives us:\n\n16 - y^2 = (25/9)y^2 yielding the quadratic equation (25/9)y^2 + y^2 - 16 = 0 or (34/9)y^2 - 16 = 0. Solving for y gives us y = \u00b1 3\u221a14/\u221a34. \n\nNow we can substitute y back into circle's equation to find that x = \u00b1 \u221a2.\n\nFrom these, it's easy to observe that the four points of intersection are (\u00b1 \u221a2, \u00b1 3\u221a14/\u221a34). Plotting these on the graph (which isn't necessary, but is useful for visualization), we can see that these form a rectangle which is rotated 45 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nThe dimensions of this rectangle are the distances between the points (\u00b1 \u221a2, \u00b1 3\u221a14/\u221a34) and (\u00b1 \u221a2, \u2213 3\u221a14/\u221a34), which come out as 6\u221a14/\u221a34  (vertical), and 2\u221a2 (horizontal).\n\nThe area of a rectangle is length times width, so the area of this rectangle is 6\u221a14/\u221a34 * 2\u221a2 = \\boxed{24\u221a(14/17)}."}
