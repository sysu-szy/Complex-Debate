Hence,\n\\[16 - 4(m)(-4m + 12) = 0.\\]This simplifies to $m^2 - 3m + 1 = 0.$  Let the roots be $m_1$ and $m_2.$  Then by Vieta's formulas, $m_1 + m_2 = 3$ and $m_1 m_2 = 1,$ so\n\\[(m_1 - m_2)^2 = (m_1 + m_2)^2 - 4m_1 m_2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\\]We know that $y$ is a double root of $my^2 - 4y + (-4m + 12) = 0,$ so by completing the square we can see that the corresponding values of $y$ are $y_1 = \\frac{2}{m_1} = 2m_2$ and $y_2 = \\frac{2}{m_2} = 2m_1.$  Then\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{y_1^2}{4} = m_2^2\\]and\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{y_2^2}{4} = m_1^2.\\]Therefore, $A$ and $B$ are $(m_1^2,2m_1)$ and $(m_2^2,2m_2),$ in some order.\n\nSo if $d = AB,$ then\n\\begin{align*}\nd^2 &= (m_2^2 - m_1^2)^2 + (2m_2 - 2m_1)^2 \\\\\n&= (m_1 + m_2)^2 (m_1 - m_2)^2 + 4 (m_1 - m_2)^2 \\\\\n&= 3^2 \\cdot 5 + 4 \\cdot 5 = 65,\n\\end{align*}so $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{65}}.$", "agents_response": "The parabola $y^2 = 4px$ represents a family of parabolas with focal length $p$. Here, $p=1$. The focus of the parabola $y^2 = 4px$ is $(p,0)$, which in this case is $(1,0)$. The directrix is $x = -p$, which is $x = -1$ in this case.\n\nThe point $(1,3)$ lies outside the parabola, and hence the tangents from $(1,3)$ touch the parabola at two distinct points. Let $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ be these points.\n\nAny point $(x,y)$ on the parabola $y^2 = 4 px$ can be written as $(at^2, 2at)$ for some real number $t$. Hence, let $(x_1,y_1) = (at_1^2, 2at_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (at_2^2, 2at_2)$.\n\nThe slope of the line joining the point $(1,3)$ to $(x_i,y_i)$ (where $(x_i,y_i)$ is any point on the parabola) is given by $\\frac{y_i-3}{x_i-1}$. Since the line $(1,3)-(x_i,y_i)$ is a tangent to the parabola at $(x_i,y_i)$, this slope is also equal to the slope of the tangent at $(x_i,y_i)$. \n\nWe know that $y = mx + \\frac{am^2}{2} - am$ represents all tangents to the parabola $y^2 = 4ax$, where $m$ is the slope. If a line $y = mx + c$ is a tangent to the parabola, then $c = \\frac{am^2}{2} - am$. \n\nFrom the above two points, we have $\\frac{y_i-3}{x_i-1} = \\frac{2y_i}{x_i}$, or $x_iy_i = x_i -3y_i + 3$. Substitute for $x_i$ and $y_i$ to give $at_i^2.2at_i = at_i^2 - 3.2at_i + 1$, which simplifies to $at_i^3 - 3at_i - 1 = 0$. Thus $t_i^3-3t_i-1=0$. $(t_1,t_2)$ are the roots of this equation, and product of the roots is $- 1 = t_1.t_2$\n\nThen, $x_1.x_2 = (a.t_1^2).(a.t_2^2) = a^2.t_1^2.t_2^2 = a^2 = 1^2 = 1$ because $t_1.t_2=-1$.\n\nAgain, since $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ lie on the parabola $y^2 = 4px$, we have $y_1^2 = 4px_1$ and $y_2^2 = 4px_2$.\nSo, $y_1.y_2 = \\sqrt{4px_1.4px_2} = 2\\sqrt{p^2.x_1.x_2} = 2\\sqrt{(1^2).(1)} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the chord joining $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}=\\sqrt{(1)^2+(2)^2}=\\sqrt{1+4}= \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."}
