{"question": "A regular tetrahedron is a pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet $V$ be the volume of a regular tetrahedron whose sides each have length $1$. What is the exact value of $V^2$ ?", "answer": "Let $A,B,C,$ and $D$ be the corners of a regular tetrahedron of side length $1$. Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to face $ABC$, and let $h$ be the height $DP$: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a = (0,0,0);\ntriple b = (1,0,0);\ntriple c = (1/2,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple d = (1/2,sqrt(3)/6,sqrt(6)/3);\ntriple p = (a+b+c)/3;\n\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),pink,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--d--b);\ndraw(c--a--b,dashed); draw(a--d--p--b,dashed);\ndraw(p+(d-p)*0.08--p+(d-p)*0.08+(b-p)*sqrt(2)*0.08--p+(b-p)*sqrt(2)*0.08);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d); dot(p);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,ENE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,WSW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,ESE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,N);\nlabel(\"$P$\",p,E);\nlabel(\"$h$\",0.45*d+0.55*p,W);\n[/asy] Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $$h^2+(PA)^2 = h^2+(PB)^2 = h^2+(PC)^2 = 1,$$so $PA=PB=PC$. The only point on face $ABC$ that is equidistant from $A,B,$ and $C$ is the intersection of the altitudes. If $M$ is the midpoint of $AC$, then $\\triangle CPM$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle with $CM=\\frac 12$, so $PC=\\frac 2{\\sqrt 3}\\cdot\\frac 12=\\frac 1{\\sqrt 3}$.\n\nTherefore, $$h=\\sqrt{1-(PC)^2} = \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac 1{\\sqrt 3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac 13} = \\sqrt{\\frac 23} = \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{\\sqrt 3},$$and the volume of tetrahedron $ABCD$ is \\begin{align*}\nV &= \\frac 13\\cdot(\\text{area of }\\triangle ABC)\\cdot h \\\\\n&= \\frac 13\\cdot\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 1\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 3}2\\right)\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{\\sqrt 3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{12};\n\\end{align*}the square of the volume is $$V^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{144} = \\boxed{\\frac 1{72}}.$$", "agents_response": "Step 1: We know that the height of the equilateral triangle face on one of the sides is given by $\\sqrt{3}/2$ (from properties of 30-60-90 right triangles). \n\nStep 2: We want to find the perpendicular height from the base of the tetrahedron to the vertex. This can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The \"base\" in this context refers to an equilateral triangle, one of the faces of the tetrahedron. The \"height\" is the perpendicular line drawn from the base to the vertex of the tetrahedron (forming a right-angle). \n\nStep 3: The square of the height (call it $h$) is equal to the square of the side length of the tetrahedron (which is 1) minus the square of half the height of the equilateral triangle, which gives us $h^2=1 - (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2=1 - 3/4 = 1/4$. Taking square roots of both sides gives $h=\\sqrt{1/4}=1/2$.\n\nStep 4: We can now calculate the volume of the tetrahedron using the formula for the volume of a pyramid, which is $\\frac{1}{3}$ times the base area times the height. The base area ($A$) of an equilateral triangle with side length of 1 is given by $\\sqrt{3}/4$. Our height ($h$) is $1/2$. Therefore, the volume $V=1/3 * A * h = 1/3 * \\sqrt{3}/4 * 1/2 = \\sqrt{3}/24$.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we square the volume to get $V^2=(\\sqrt{3}/24)^2=3/576 = 1/192$.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{192}}."}
