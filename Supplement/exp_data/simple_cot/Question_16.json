{"question": "Let $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x-3}$.  Find the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x)=f(f(x))$.", "answer": "There are two ways for $x$ to not be in the domain of $g$: it can not be in the domain of $f$, or it can be in the domain of $f$ but not in the domain of $f\\circ f$.  In the first case, the denominator of $f$ is zero, so\n$$x-3=0\\Rightarrow x=3.$$For the second case, we see that the denominator of $f(f(x))$ is $\\frac{1}{x-3}-3$.  If this is zero, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} = 3 \\implies x-3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x = 3+\\frac13 = \\frac{10}3.\\]This is greater than $3$, so the largest $x$ not in the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{\\tfrac{10}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "To find the values of $x$ that are not in the domain of $g(x) = f(f(x))$, we first have to find when $f(x)$ and $f(f(x))$ is undefined.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is undefined when $x = 3$ because that would make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero and division by zero is undefined. \n\nTherefore, $x \\neq 3$ to make $f(x)$ defined.\n\nNext, we want to find the values of $x$ that would make $f(f(x))$ undefined. This would occur when $f(x) = 3$. \n\nTo find this, we set $f(x)$ equal to $3$ and solve for $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x - 3} &= 3\\\\\n1 &= 3(x - 3)\\\\\nx - 3 &= \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx &= \\frac{1}{3} + 3\\\\\nx &= 3\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, $f(f(x))$ is undefined when $x = 3$ and when $x = 3\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $x$ is not in the domain of $g(x) = f(f(x))$ when $x = 3$ and when $x = 3\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSince $3\\frac{1}{3} > 3$, the largest $x$ that is not in the domain of $g(x) = f(f(x))$ is $3\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThus, the answer is $3\\frac{1}{3}$, or \\boxed{10/3}."}
