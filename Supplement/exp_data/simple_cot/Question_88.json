{"question": "How many ways are there to answer a $10$-question true/false test, where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false?", "answer": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}", "agents_response": "Step 1: Find out the total number of ways to answer a $10$-question true/false test disregarding any restrictions. \n\nA true/false question has $2$ possible answers: true or false. Therefore, for a test with $10$ questions, the total number of ways to answer the test (without any restrictions) is $2^{10} = 1024$ ways.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the ways where fewer than three questions are answered with a false.\n\nWhen no question is answered with a false, there's only one way to answer the test - all answers are true. \n\nWhen one question is answered with a false, there are $10$ different questions that could be the one that is answered with a false, and the rest would be answered with a true. Therefore, there are $10$ ways.\n\nWhen two questions are answered with a false, there are $\\binom{10}{2}=45$ combinations to choose which two questions are answered with a false.\n\nAdding those up, we get $1 + 10 + 45 = 56$ ways to answer the test with fewer than three false responses.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the result from step 2 from the result from step 1.\n\nThe final result is the total number of ways to answer the test, minus the ways where fewer than three questions are answered with a false. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to answer the $10$-question true/false test where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false is $1024 - 56$ \\boxed{968}."}
