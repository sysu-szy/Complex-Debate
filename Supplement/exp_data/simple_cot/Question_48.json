{"question": "Between what two consecutive integers on the number line is the graph of the sum $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}$ located? Enter your answer in the form \"$m$ and $n$\", where $m$ and $n$ are replaced by appropriate numbers.", "answer": "Since $25<30<36$, we have $5<\\sqrt{30}<6$. We also know that $7^2=49$, so $\\sqrt{50}\\approx7$. As a result, $(5+7)<\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$, so the sum is located between $\\boxed{12\\text{ and }13}$.\n\nTo be more precise, $\\sqrt{50}>7$, but we're still able to say that $\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$ when we add a slightly greater quantity to the left side since the difference between $6$ and $\\sqrt{30}$ is much greater than the difference between $\\sqrt{50}$ and $7$.", "agents_response": "First, simplify the sum $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}$.\n\nFrom the properties of square roots, we know that $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}$ does not simplify further, so we will use a calculator to determine the decimal approximation. \n\nWe have $\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.48$ and $\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07$, So $\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50} \\approx 12.55$.\n\nLooking at this value, it should be clear that it falls between the numbers 12 and 13. \n\nThus, the graph of the sum is between the consecutive integers 12 and 13.\n\nYour answer is \\boxed{12 and 13}."}
