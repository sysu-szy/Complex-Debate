{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\\boxed{60}$.", "agents_response": "The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer $n>1$ whose positive divisors when multiplied together give $n^6$.\n\nLet's start by realizing that $n^6 = (n^3)^2$. This means that if we multiply the positive divisors of $n$ together, they should give us $n^3$.\n\nSo we need to find a number where the square root of the product of its divisors is $n^3$. \n\nThis corresponds to the geometric mean of the divisors equaling $n^3$. \n\nFor this to hold, the arithmetic mean of the divisors must also be $n^3$ due to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means. \n\nSo, we must have a number with the sum of its divisors being $k*n^3$ where $k$ is the number of divisors of $n$.\n\nWe know that $n=1$ makes the inequality hold, however, the problem states that $n>1$.\n\nSince we're looking for the smallest positive integer greater than 1, let's investigate $n=2$. \n\nThe divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. The sum of these divisors is 3. This gives us $k*n^3 = 2*2^3 = 16$. \n\nUnfortunately, this does not match our sum of divisors (which is 3), so $n=2$ is not the answer.\n\nNext, let's try $n=3$. The divisors would be 1, 3. Summing these gives 4. This time we have $k*n^3 = 2*3^3 = 54$.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match. \n\nNext, let's try $n=4$. The divisors are 1, 2, 4. The sum is 7.\n\nAgain, we have $k*n^3 = 3*4^3 = 192$.\n\nThis still does not match. \n\nNext, let try $n = 8$. It's divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8. The sum of these divisors is 15. \n\n$k*n^3 = 4*8^3 = 2048$.\n\nAgain, we do not have a match. \n\nFinally, let's try $n = 12$. It's divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The sum is 28. \n\n$k*n^3 = 6*12^3 = 10368$.\n\nAgain, we don't have a match. \n\nWe can see that finding a solution in this way might be lengthy and complicated, so we now try a different approach considering the prime factorization of a number.\n\nGiven a prime factorization of a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}....p_m^{a_m}$, the product of its divisors is $(p_1^{a_1}(p_1^{a_1}+1)...(p_m^{a_m}(p_m^{a_m}+1))/2$ which is equal to $n^{(a_1+a_2+...+a_m+1)/2}$. When the result is $n^6$, $(a_1+a_2+...+a_m+1)/2 = 6$.\n\nThis means we want to find prime factors and their exponents such that a number n in the prime factorization form satisfies $(a_1+a_2+...+a_m+1)/2 = 6$. \n\nThis can have different possible scenarios; \n\nOne scenario would be having one prime with its exponent as 11. The smallest prime is 2, so we have a potential answer of $2^{11}$.\n\nBut another possible scenario is having three primes each with their exponent at 3, as $3+3+3+1 = 10$ and dividing this by 2 also gives us 6.\n\nTrying the smallest three primes 2, 3 and 5 for this scenario gives us $2^3*3^3*5^3 = 54000$.\n\nComparing this with the first potential answer, $2^{11} = 2048$.\n\nWe see that $2^{11}$, or 2048, is smaller. \n\nThus, we have found the smallest such $n$. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{2048}$."}
