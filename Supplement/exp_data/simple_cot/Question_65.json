{"question": "The sum of the product and the sum of two positive integers is $454$. Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product.", "answer": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$. We list all possibilities: \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$a+1$&$b+1$&$a$&$b$\\\\ \\hline\n$1$&$455$&$0$&$454$\\\\\n$5$&$91$&$4$&$90$\\\\\n$7$&$65$&$6$&$64$\\\\\n$13$&$35$&$12$&$34$\n\\end{tabular}We must find the largest possible value of \"the product of their sum and their product\", or $ab\\cdot(a+b)$. We know the first possibility above gives a value of zero, while all the others will be greater than zero. We check: \\begin{align*}\n4\\cdot 90\\cdot (4+90)&=4\\cdot 90\\cdot 94=33840\\\\\n6\\cdot 64\\cdot (6+64)&=6\\cdot 64\\cdot 70=26880\\\\\n12\\cdot 34\\cdot (12+34)&=12\\cdot 34\\cdot 46=18768.\n\\end{align*}Thus the largest possible desired value is $\\boxed{33840}$, achieved when $(a,b)=(4,90)$.", "agents_response": "Firstly, let's denote by x and y the two positive integers. Then, from the given we have: xy + x + y = 454, or equivalently x(y+1) + y = 454. Since x and y are positive integers, y+1 must also be a positive integer.\n\nWe focus on the product xy(x+y). If we rewrite this in terms of (y+1), we get an expression in the form x(y+1)x - x^2, which is a quadratic function. The maximum of a quadratic function ax^2+bx+c is obtained at x = -b/(2a). In our case, a = -1, and b = (y+1), so the maximum is obtained at x = -b/(2a) = -(y+1)/(2*-1) = (y+1)/2, but since x and y are integers, x must also be an integer. \n\nSince y+1 is a positive integer, we choose the largest x that is smaller than (y+1)/2, which is either floor((y+1)/2) or floor((y+1)/2) - 1. \n\nSubstitute it back into the original condition x(y+1) + y = 454, we try larger values for y and find that when y = 26 (then x = 13), we fulfill the condition. And substituting y = 13 and x = 26 also fulfills the condition. This means that the maximum value of product is either when x = 13, y = 26 or when x = 26, y = 13. Both will give the maximum value for the product xy(x+y) = 13*26*(13+26) = 13*26*39 = \\boxed{13254}."}
