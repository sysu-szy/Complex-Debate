{"question": "One hundred concentric circles with radii $1,2,3,\\ldots,100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius $1$ is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "answer": "The sum of the areas of the green regions is \\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{=}\\\n\\left[(2^2-1^2)+(4^2-3^2)+(6^2-5^2)+\\cdots+(100^2-99^2)\\right]\\pi\\\\\n&=\\left[(2+1)+(4+3)+(6+5)+\\cdots+(100+99)\\right]\\pi\\\\\n&={1\\over2}\\cdot100\\cdot101\\pi.\n\\end{align*}Thus the desired ratio is $${1\\over2}\\cdot{{100\\cdot101\\pi}\\over{100^2\\pi}}={101\\over200},$$and $m+n=\\boxed{301}$.", "agents_response": "Step 1: Determine the colors\nSince no two adjacent regions can be the same color, the colors alternate starting with the innermost circle. Therefore, the circles with radii 1, 3, 5,..., 99 are red, and the circles with radii 2, 4, 6...,100 are green.\n\nStep 2: Determine the area\nThe area of the green regions is the sum of the areas of all the green circles. The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r^2, so the area of each green circle is \n\n\u03c0(2^2) + \u03c0(4^2) + \u03c0(6^2) + ... + \u03c0(100^2)\n\nThis is a sum of squares that can be simplified to \u03c0(2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + ... + 100^2)\n\nStep 3: Simplify the sum of squares\nThe sum of the squares of the first n even numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)(2n+1)/3. In this case, n = 50 (because 100/2 = 50), so the sum of the squares is \n\n50*51*101/3\n\nStep 4: Substitute back into the area formula\nSubstitute the sum of squares back into the area formula to get \n\n\u03c0(50*51*101/3) = 85050\u03c0/3 square units\n\nStep 5: Calculate the area of the largest circle\nThe area of the largest circle, which is the circle of radius 100, is \u03c0(100^2) = 10000\u03c0 square units\n\nStep 6: Calculate the ratio\nThe ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 is (85050\u03c0/3)/10000\u03c0 = 85050/30000 = 2835/1000\n\nStep 7: Simplify to lowest terms\nThe ratio 2835/1000 simplifies to 567/200. \n\nStep 8: Find m and n\nIn the fraction 567/200, m = 567 and n = 200. \n\nStep 9: Add m and n\n567 + 200 = 767.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{767}."}
