{"question": "Suppose $m$ is a two-digit positive integer such that $6^{-1}\\pmod m$ exists and $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$. What is $m$?", "answer": "We can multiply both sides of the congruence $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$ by $6$: $$\n\\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^{-1}}_1 \\equiv \\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^2}_{6^3} \\pmod m.\n$$Thus $6^3-1=215$ is a multiple of $m$. We know that $m$ has two digits. The only two-digit positive divisor of $215$ is $43$, so $m=\\boxed{43}$.", "agents_response": "The question states that $6^{-1}$ is congruent to $6^2$ modulo $m$ and that $6^{-1} \\pmod m$ exists. This means that $6$ must be relatively prime to $m$, which implies that $m$ can't be divisible by $2$ or $3$.\n\nNote that $6^2 = 36$. So, $m$ is a positive two-digit integer such that $6^{-1}\\equiv 36\\pmod m$.\n\nThat means that, under modular arithmetic, the multiplicative inverse of $6$ is $36$, modulo $m$. In other words, $6*36 =1\\pmod m$.\n\nThis simplifies to $216 = 1\\pmod m$.\n\nThe two-digit numbers that satisfy this are $m= 71$ and $m=107$, but since $m$ has to be a two-digit number, the only valid solution would be $m=71$.\n\nSo, our answer is \\boxed{71}."}
