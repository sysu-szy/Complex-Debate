{"question": "A 420-page book contains an average of 600 words per page, and Roslyn reads the book at the rate of 360 words per minute. How many hours did it take her to read the book? Express your answer as a mixed number.", "answer": "This book contains $420\\times 600 = 252000$ words. Roslyn reads at 360 words per minute, so it takes her $\\frac{252000}{360} = 700$ minutes to read the book. To find how many hours it took her, we divide by 60: $\\frac{700}{60} = \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "First, we need to find the total number of words in the book. We can do this by multiplying the number of pages in the book by the average number of words on each page. \n\n420 pages \u00d7 600 words/page = 252,000 words\n\nNext, we divide the total number of words by the rate at which Roslyn reads to find the total time she spent reading. Remember that we need to convert the time from minutes to hours, since the problem asks for the time in hours.\n\n252,000 words \u00f7 360 words/minute = 700 minutes\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60.\n\n700 minutes \u00f7 60 = 11 hours and 40 minutes\n\n40 minutes is 2/3 of an hour. Therefore, Roslyn spent 11 2/3 hours reading the book. \n\nThus the answer is \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}} hours."}
