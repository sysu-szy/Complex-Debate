{"question": "A textbook has 1,000 pages.  How many of the pages have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4?", "answer": "There are only a few ways to make one, two, and three digit numbers add up to $4$.  The only one-digit number whose sum is $4$ is $4$ itself.  Continuing with two-digit numbers, we note that the digits must be $4$ and $0$, $1$ and $3$, or $2$ and $2$.  This means that $13$, $22$, $31$, and $40$ are the only two-digit numbers whose digits sum to 4.  For the three-digit numbers, we organize the work in a table.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\nPossible Digits&Possible Numbers&Total Possibilities\\\\\\hline\n4,0,0&400&1\\\\\\hline\n3,1,0&103, 130, 301, 310&4\\\\\\hline\n2,2,0&202, 220&2\\\\\\hline\n2,1,1&112, 121, 211&3\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}Adding up the last column, we see that there are $10$ three-digits numbers whose digits add up to $4$.  Adding those to the possible one-and-two digit numbers, we get $\\boxed{15}$ pages in the textbook which have digits that add up to $4$.", "agents_response": "In order to determine the total number of pages that have digits summing up to exactly 4, we first need to consider all possible conditions where the sum of digits would result to 4.\n\nFirstly, we notice that this can't happen when the page number is less than 4 or greater than 400 since the textbook only has 1000 pages. \n\nThus, a one digit page number thus can't meet the condition. So focusing on two digit numbers, the ways the sum can be formed are: 13 (i.e., 4, 13, 22, 31), 4 (i.e., 40), and 112 (i.e., 103, 112, 121, 130). Searching for consistency, each of these cases has 4 instances. Thus, we have 4*4 = 16 two digit numbers whose sum equals 4.\n\nLooking at three digit numbers, we can have the following ways: 103 (i.e., 103, 112, 121, 130, 202, 211, 220, 301, 310, 400), 112 (i.e., 104, 113, 122, 131, 140, 203, 212, 221, 230, 302, 311, 320, 401, 410), and 400. Clearly, this is 10 + 14 + 1 = 25 three digit numbers.\n\nHence, by summing these up, we have 16 + 25 = \\boxed{41} pages that have digits that add up to exactly 4."}
