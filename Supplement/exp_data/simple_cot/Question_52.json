{"question": "We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and\n\n$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd\n\n$f(b)=\\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.\n\nWhat is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?", "answer": "Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \\begin{align*}\nf(11)&=34\\\\\nf(34)&=17\\\\\nf(17)&=52\\\\\nf(52)&=26\\\\\nf(26)&=13\\\\\nf(13)&=40\\\\\nf(40)&=20\\\\\nf(20)&=10\\\\\nf(10)&=5\\\\\nf(5)&=16\\\\\nf(16)&=8\\\\\nf(8)&=4\\\\\nf(4)&=2\\\\\nf(2)&=1\\\\\nf(1)&=4\n\\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\\boxed{18}$.", "agents_response": "We start at $f(14)=7$. As $7$ is odd, we apply $f(b)=3b+1$ and get $f(7)=3*7+1=22$.\n\nSince $22$ is even, we apply $f(b)=\\frac{b}{2}$ and get $f(22)=\\frac{22}{2}=11$.\n\nFollowing similar steps with odd number $11$, get us $f(11)=3*11+1=34$.\n\nApplying the rule for even numbers, $f(34)=\\frac{34}{2}=17$.\n\nContinue the process with $17$, $f(17)=3*17+1=52$\n\nAnd with $52$, $f(52)=\\frac{52}{2}=26$\n\nAgain, applying the rules for even numbers, we get: $f(26)=\\frac{26}{2}=13$.\n\nFor odd number $13$, $f(13)=3*13+1=40$.\n\nFor $40$, we use the even rule and get $f(40)=\\frac{40}{2}=20$.\n\nThen, $f(20)=\\frac{20}{2}=10$, and $f(10)=\\frac{10}{2}=5$\n\nThen, $f(5)=3*5+1=16$, $f(16)=\\frac{16}{2}=8$ and $f(8)=\\frac{8}{2}=4$\n\nProceeding further with $f(4)=\\frac{4}{2}=2$ and finally $f(2)=\\frac{2}{2}=1$\n\nAs $1$ is the last value as it generates a cycle with $4$ with the given rules, we do not need to continue any further.\n\nCounting the number of integers, $14$, $7$, $22$, $11$, $34$, $17$, $52$, $26$, $13$, $40$, $20$, $10$, $5$, $16$, $8$, $4$, $2$, $1$ we get \\boxed{18} as the answer. This signifies that $f$ should be defined on at least $\\boxed{18}$ numbers."}
