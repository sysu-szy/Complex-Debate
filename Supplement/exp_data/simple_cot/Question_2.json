{"question": "A point $(2, n)$ is 5 units away from the point $(-1, 1)$. What is the product of all possible integer values for $n$?", "answer": "By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from $(2,n)$ to $(-1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{(2-(-1))^2+(n-1)^2}$.  Setting this equal to $5$, we find \\begin{align*}\n9+(n-1)^2 &= 25 \\implies \\\\\n(n-1)^2 &= 16 \\implies \\\\\nn-1 = 4 \\quad&\\text{or}\\quad n-1=-4 \\implies \\\\\nn = 5 \\quad&\\text{or}\\quad n=-3.\n\\end{align*} Both of these solutions are integers, and their product is $\\boxed{-15}$.", "agents_response": "The two points would be 5 units away from each other if the distance between them (as calculated by the distance formula, \u221a((x2-x1)\u00b2+(y2-y1)\u00b2), is equated to 5. So, we can start by plugging in the given points into the distance formula and equating it to 5:\n\n5 = \u221a((2 - (-1))\u00b2+(n - 1)\u00b2)\n\nMap it out:\n\n5 = \u221a((3)\u00b2+(n - 1)\u00b2)\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of square root:\n\n25 = 9 + (n - 1)\u00b2\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n16 = (n - 1)\u00b2\n\nIf we take square root for the both side, we have \n\n\u00b14 = n - 1\n\nSo, the possible integer values of n are 5 and -3, when added and subtracted with 1. \n\nThe product of all possible values for n is (5)(-3) = \\boxed{-15}."}
