{"question": "Two standard six-faced dice are rolled. Jean wins if the product of the two numbers rolled is odd or a multiple of three, otherwise Allen wins. What is the probability that Jean wins? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "When two dice are rolled, there are 36 total outcomes. Let's compute the probability that Allen wins. Allen wins if the product of the two numbers is even and not a multiple of 3. In other words, Allen wins if the product is 2 $(1\\cdot2, 2\\cdot1)$, 4 $(1\\cdot4, 4\\cdot1, 2\\cdot2)$, 8 $(2\\cdot4, 4\\cdot2)$, 10 $(2\\cdot5, 5\\cdot2)$, 16 $(4\\cdot4)$, or 20 $(4\\cdot5, 5\\cdot4)$. Therefore, the probability that Allen wins is $\\frac{2+3+2+2+1+2}{36}=12/36=1/3$. Then, the probability that Jean wins is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.", "agents_response": "There are 36 equally likely outcomes when two six-sided dice are rolled, each of which results in a pair of integers between 1 and 6. A product is odd if and only if both factors are odd. Since each die has 3 odd numbers (1, 3, and 5), there are 3*3=9 odd products.\n\nFor the product to be a multiple of 3, at least one factor has to be a multiple of 3. There are 2 multiples of 3 (3 and 6) on each die. So there are 2*6=12 ways to get a multiple of 3 from the first die, and another 2*6=12 ways to get a multiple of 3 from the second die. Hence there are 12+12=24 ways to get a product that is a multiple of 3. However, we are double counting the cases where the product is odd and a multiple of 3 (for instance, 3*3, 3*3). But we already counted these cases once in the 9 odd products, so we need to subtract them out. There are 3*2=6 ways to roll two odd multiples of 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes for Jean is 9 odd products + 24 products that are multiples of 3 - 6 overlap = 27. \n\nSo the probability that Jean wins is 27 out of 36 = 27/36 = \\boxed{3/4}."}
