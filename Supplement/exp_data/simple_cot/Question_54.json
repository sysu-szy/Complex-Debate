{"question": "Find the smallest positive integer that is greater than $1$ and relatively prime to the product of the first 20 positive integers.  Reminder: two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.", "answer": "Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no prime factors.  Therefore, the desired positive integer must not share any prime factors with the product of the first 20 positive integers.  So, every prime in the prime factorization of the desired positive integer is greater than 20, which means the smallest possible integer is $\\boxed{23}$.", "agents_response": "Step 1: To start with the problem, we must know what it means by two numbers being relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common factor other than 1. In other words, their greatest common divisor (gcd) must be 1.\n\nStep 2: The problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer that is 'greater than 1' and 'relatively prime' to the 'product of the first 20 positive integers'. \n\nStep 3: The 'product of the first 20 positive integers' can be represented as 20!. This includes every prime number up to 20 and all their multiples.\n\nStep 4: So, the integer we are looking for must not have any prime factor that is less than or equal to 20.\n\nStep 5: The smallest prime number greater than 20 is 23.\n\nStep 6: Thus, \\boxed{23} is the smallest positive integer that is 'greater than 1' and 'relatively prime' to the 'product of the first 20 positive integers'."}
