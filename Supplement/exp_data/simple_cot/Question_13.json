{"question": "A shop sells 500 smartphones a week for $\\$450$ each. A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars?", "answer": "Suppose the price of the cellphone is reduced to $450 - 5x$ dollars; then it will sell $500 + 10x$ units, so the revenue will be\n\\begin{align*}\n(450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) &= 5(90 - x) 10(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (90 - x)(50 + x) \\\\\n&= 50 (-x^2  + 40x + 4500),\n\\end{align*}in dollars.\n\nCompleting the square on $-x^2 + 40x + 4500,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n50 (-x^2 + 40x + 4500) &= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 400 + 4500) \\\\\n&= 50 (-(x - 20)^2 + 4900) \\\\\n&= -50 (x - 20)^2 + 245000.\n\\end{align*}This is maximized when $x = 20,$ so the optimal price of the smartphone is $450 - 5(20) = \\boxed{350}$ dollars.", "agents_response": "Denote the number of $5 decreases in price as x. The number of smartphones sold then becomes 500 + 10x and the new price becomes 450 - 5x.\n\nThe revenue R can be expressed as the product of the number of smartphones sold and the price per smartphone, so R = (500 + 10x)(450 - 5x)\n\nExpanding this, we get R = 225000 - 2500x + 4500x - 50x^2 = -50x^2 + 2000x + 225000\n\nThe revenue will reach a maximum value where the derivative of the revenue with respect to x is zero. So we need to solve for x in the equation R' = -100x + 2000 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 2000 / 100 = 20\n\nSubstituting x = 20 back into the price function, we get the price that will result in maximum revenue: P = 450 - 5*20 = \\$350.\n\nSo, the price that would result in maximum revenue is \\$350.\n\n\\boxed{350}."}
