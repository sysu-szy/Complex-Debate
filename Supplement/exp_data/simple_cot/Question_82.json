{"question": "Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.", "answer": "Let the roots be $r$ and $s$ (not necessarily real).  We take the cases where $r = s$ and $r \\neq s.$\n\nCase 1: $r = s.$\n\nSince $r$ is the only root, we must have $r^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ which factors as $(r - 2)(r + 1) = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$  This leads to the quadratics $x^2 - 4x + 4$ and $x^2 + 2x + 1.$\n\nCase 2: $r \\neq s.$\n\nEach of $r^2 - 2$ and $s^2 - 2$ must be equal to $r$ or $s.$  We have three cases:\n\n(i) $r^2 - 2 = r$ and $s^2 - 2 = s.$\n\n(ii) $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$\n\n(iii) $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r$.\n\nIn case (i), as seen from Case $r,$ $s \\in \\{2,-1\\}.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2.$\n\nIn case (ii), $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r.$  Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[r^2 - s^2 = s - r.\\]Then $(r - s)(r + s) = s - r.$  Since $r - s \\neq 0,$ we can divide both sides by $r - s,$ to get $r + s = -1.$  Adding the equations $r^2 - 2 = s$ and $s^2 - 2 = r,$ we get\n\\[r^2 + s^2 - 4 = r + s = -1,\\]so $r^2 + s^2 = 3.$  Squaring the equation $r + s = -1,$ we get $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 1,$ so $2rs = -2,$ or $rs = -1.$  Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $x^2 + x - 1.$\n\nIn case (iii), $r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r.$  Then $r^2 - r - 2 = 0,$ so $r = 2$ or $r = -1.$\n\nIf $r = 2,$ then $s^2 = 4,$ so $s = -2.$  (We are assuming that $r \\neq s.$)  This leads to the quadratic $(x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4.$\n\nIf $r = -1$, then $s^2 = 1,$ so $s = 1.$  This leads to the quadratic $(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1.$\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{6}$ quadratic equations that work, namely $x^2 - 4x + 4,$ $x^2 + 2x + 1,$ $x^2 - x - 2,$ $x^2 + x - 1,$ $x^2 - 4,$ and $x^2 - 1.$", "agents_response": "Step 1: Identify the conditions\nThe problem tells us that whenever c is a root of the equation, c^2 - 2 is also a root of the equation. This means that if c is a root, and c^2 - 2 is a root, then they should satisfy the equation. \n\nStep 2: Set the conditions \nFor a quadratic equation of the form x^2 + ax + b = 0, if c is a root, then we have the equation c^2 + ac + b = 0. If c^2 - 2 is a root, then we have the equation (c^2 - 2)^2 + a(c^2 - 2) + b = 0.\n\nStep 3: Create a system of equations \nFrom the second condition, we can develop the equation: c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 + ac^2 - 2a + b = 0 \n\nStep 4: Compare the coefficients\nComparing the coefficients of the terms on both sides, we find that a = -2 and b = -2a = 4. \n\nStep 5: Substitute these values into the original equation\nSubstituting a and b into x^2 + ax + b = 0, we have x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0. \n\nStep 6: Determine the uniqueness of the quadratic equation\nThere is one unique such quadratic equation. Hence the number of quadratic equations that fulfill the conditions is one. \n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{1}."}
