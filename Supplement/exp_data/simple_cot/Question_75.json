{"question": "A $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle is drawn on the exterior of an equilateral triangle so the hypotenuse of the right triangle is one side of the equilateral triangle. If the shorter leg of the right triangle is 6 units, what is the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw((2,0)--(0,0)--(1,1.732)--(2,1.732)--(2,0)--(1,1.732));\ndraw((2,1.632)--(1.9,1.632)--(1.9,1.732));\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(1,1.732),2SE+E);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\",(2,0),5NNW+4N);\nlabel(\"6\",(1.5,1.732),N);\n[/asy]", "answer": "Multiply the short leg of the right triangle by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find that the length of the longer leg is $6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  Double the short leg of the right triangle to find that the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 12 units.  Since the hypotenuse of the right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 12 units.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between the two vertices that the two triangles do not have in common is $\\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{3})^2+12^2}=\\sqrt{252}=\\boxed{6\\sqrt{7}}$ units. [asy]\ndraw((2,0)--(0,0)--(1,sqrt(3))--(2,sqrt(3))--(2,0)--(1,sqrt(3)));\ndraw((2,sqrt(3)-0.1)--(1.9,sqrt(3)-0.1)--(1.9,sqrt(3)));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,sqrt(3)));\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(1,sqrt(3)),2SE+E);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\",(2,0),5NNW+4N);\nlabel(\"6\",(1.5,sqrt(3)),N);\nlabel(\"$6\\sqrt{3}$\",(2,sqrt(3)/2),E);\nlabel(\"12\",(1.5,sqrt(3)/2),SW);\nlabel(\"12\",(1,0),S);\n[/asy]", "agents_response": "Since the triangle is an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length, which means that the hypotenuse of the $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle is also 6 units. Since in a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the $30^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$ angles, respectively, is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, the longer leg of the right triangle is $6\\sqrt{3}$ units.\n\nNow, suppose we denote the two points where the equilateral triangle and the right triangle meet as A and B. Then, the segment connecting the other two vertices of the triangles is the difference between two sides of the equilateral triangle, which is $6 - 6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nBut since we want the distance, which is always positive, the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common is $6\\sqrt{3} - 6$.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{6\\sqrt{3} - 6}."}
