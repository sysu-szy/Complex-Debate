In order to minimize the total number, I initially sought the smallest 'D' that satisfies both inequalities. \n\nTo achieve this, I used the approach of equating the two inequalities:\n\n(2/3)D + 3 = 2D\nWhich gave:\nD = 9/4 or 2.25\n\nRegardless of the fraction I got, we know that 'D' has to be a whole integer number.

I realized upon reviewing my work that I made a grave mistake. One should not equate both inequalities to find the smallest 'D'. The inequality, 2D = (2/3)D + 3, indeed results in D = 2.25, however, this shows that D = 2.25 is where C starts to be higher in the first inequality than in the second one.
