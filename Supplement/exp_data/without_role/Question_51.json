By substituting $0$ into the equation we get $P(0) = \\frac{P(P(0))}{2}$ We don't know the specific value of P(0) yet, but this equation clarifies that $P(0)$ must be $0$ as well. This is because if $P(0)$ was non-zero we'd end up with $P(0)$ equaling half its value, which is a contradiction.\n\nRound 2: Attempt to find the degree of $P(x)$ \n\nLet's also note the degree of polynomial $P(x)$. If $n$ is the degree of $P(x)$, then $P(P(x))$ is of degree $n^2$, which leads to the conclusion that our polynomial is quadratic or linear, because the degree of the equation $P(P(x))+P(x) = 6x$ can't be more than $2$. We are leaning towards quadratic because the left side of our original equation involves some composition - so it's likely that $P(x)$ is not simply linear. \n\nRound 3: Find a possible form for >$P(x)$ \n\nGiven our conclusion from the last round, let's assume $P(x)$ to be a quadratic polynomial. So, let\u2019s write it in the form $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. We adjust this form to align with the fact that $P(0) = 0$, leading to $P(x) = ax^2 + bx$. \n\nRound 4: Use a new value of $x$ in the equation \n\nThis time, let\u2019s put $x = 1$ into the initial equation $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x$. Our earlier discussion concluded $P(x) = 0$ if $x = 0$, so now we have $P(P(1)) + P(1) = 6$. We know $P(1) = a + b$, and substituting this we get $P(a + b) + a + b = 6$. \n\nRound 5: Find the values of a and b\n\nHere, the approach is to calculate the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation derived from the previous round, i.e. $P(a + b) + a + b = 6$. Substituting $P(x) = ax^2 + bx$ we get $P(a + b) = a(a+b)^2 + b(a+b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + ab + b^2 = a^2 + 3ab + 2b^2$. Now, the equation we need $a$ and $b$ to satisfy can be written as $a^2 + 3ab + 2b^2 + a + b = 6$. For this to be true, $a$ has to be $1$ and $b$ must be $2$ because with these values the equation simplifies to $1 + 3(2) + 2(2^2) + 1 + 2 = 6$ which is true.\n\nRound 6: Use the calculated values to find P(10) \n\nUsing our calculated values $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, the polynomial $P(x) = ax^2 + bx$ is thus $P(x) = x^2 + 2x$. This gives $P(10) = 10^2 + 2 * 10 = 100 + 20 = 120$. \n\nSo, the sum of all possible values for $P(10)$ (which is equal to the only found value) is $\\boxed{120}$.", "round 1": "Looking through my initial approach and the approaches from other agents, I realize that it is not certain that our assumption that $P(x)$ is quadratic was correct.

However, a polynomial of degree 2 led to a degree of 4 when composed with itself, which did not correspond to the linear degree present on the right-hand side of the equation $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x$.\n\nMultiple agents recognize the possibility for $P(x)$ to be a linear function and find solutions for this case. Agent solution0 posts an alternative viewpoint of solving for $P(y)$ = $6x - y$, demonstrating a unique method that also suggests $P(x)$ could be linear.  \n\nAgent solution1 explores an odd-degree polynomial, which suggests a possible linear solution as well.\n\nTherefore, with a collective review, It seems that $P(x)$ could very well be a linear function. Assume we have $P(x)= ax + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Substituting this into the original equation gets us $a(ax+b) + b + ax + b = 6x$, simplifying this gives $a^2x + 2ab + 2ax + 2b = 6x$. \n\nSince the original equation holds true for all $x$, comparing the coefficients we get $a^2 + 2a = 6$ and $2ab + 2b = 0$. \nSolving the first equation gives us $a = -3$ or $a = 2$. \n\nPlugging these into the second equation gets two pairs of solutions $(a, b) = (-3, 0)$, $(a, b) = (-3, 5)$, $(a, b) = (2, 0)$ and $(a, b) = (2, -3)$.

We want to find $P(10)$, but this equation seems to involve $P(y)$, not $P(10)$.\n\nDebater 2: We can still find $P(10)$ from this equation. First, note that we can rewrite it as $P(y) = 6x - y$. \n\nDebater 1: That's true. But remember, we made the substitution $y = P(x)$. If we substitute that back into this equation, we get $P(P(x)) = 6x - P(x)$.\n\nDebater 2: But we know from the original question that $P(P(x)) = 6x - P(x)$, so we have now solved for $P(P(x))$.\n\nDebater 1: Yes, but we also know from the original question that $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x$.

The deduction that $P(x)$ must be odd because it must satisfy $P(-x) = - P(x)$ was a valid point as it is mirrored in the behavior of the right-hand side of the initial equation $P(P(x)) + P(x) = 6x$. \n\nStarting with the assumption that $P(x)$ is in the form of $ax + b$, substituting back into the initial equation led to a system of equations, $a^2 + 2a = 6$ and $2ab + 2b = 0$. Solving this system yielded four potential solutions, $(a, b) = (-3, 0)$, $(a, b) = (-3, 5)$, $(a, b) = (2, 0)$ and $(a, b) = (2, -3)$.
