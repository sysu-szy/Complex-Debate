We applied Vieta's formulas correctly initially, which yielded $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = a/4$. However, we incorrectly manipulated the given condition in the problem.\n\nInstead, we should have multiplied through by the respective denominators in the original condition, yielding $2r_1 + 4r_2 + 5r_3 + 8r_4 = 8$.\n\nFrom here, incorporating our interpretation of Vieta's formula into this condition gives $2a + 4r_2 + 5r_3 + 8r_4 = 8$. Rearranging, we get $a = 4 - 2r_2 - 5r_3/2 - 2r_4$.\n\nFrom the condition given in the problem, we have $2r_1 + 4r_2 + 5r_3/2 + 2r_4 = 4$, which gives us $r_1 = 2 - 2r_2 - 5r_3/4 - r_4$.\n\nPlugging this into the equation for $a$ obtained above yields $a = 4 - 4r_2 - 5r_3/2 + 2r_4 = 8 - 4r_2 - 5r_3 - 4r_4$.\n\nSolving this gives us $4r_2 + 5r_3 + 4r_4 = 0$, which contradicts with the fact that the roots of the polynomial are all positive.\n\nUnderstanding this, it is clear that our original approach was fundamentally flawed.\n\nExamining other agents' solutions, Agent 2's solution seems to be the most logical, primarily due to the fact that the given condition in the problem was manipulated correctly.\n\nIn particular, Agent 2 suggested creating a new polynomial that matches the manipulated equation, yielding the equation $4x'^4 - 40x'^3 + bx'^2 - cx' + 5 = 0$.\n\nBy comparing the coefficients in the $x'^3$ terms between the original quartic and the new one, we get $a/4 = 40/4$. Solving for $a$ yields $a = 40$, which is a solution that is consistent with the rest of the problem constraints and the given condition.\n\nGiven these insights, my updated solution is $a = \\boxed{40}$."}]}
