We recognize the numerator as the square of the Euclidean length of a 2-dimensional vector and wonder if completing the square might simplify things. If we rewrite $a^2 + b^2$ as $(a-b)^2 + 2ab$, then our expression becomes $\\frac{(a - b)^2 + 2ab}{a - b}$. This manoeuvre possibly indicates that we should use the AM-GM inequality at some point, since $2ab$ is involved. \n\nRound 2: \nWe can further simplify the expression by splitting it into two fractions: $\\frac{(a - b)^2}{a - b} + \\frac{2ab}{a - b}$ .  The first fraction simplifies to $a - b$, so the expression reduces to $a - b + \\frac{2ab}{a - b}$. \n\nRound 3: \nWe now want to find a lower bound for this quantity. Note that the rightmost term is undefined if $a = b$. Since the problem statement specifies that $a > b$, we know that $a - b$ must be strictly greater than zero, so we can continue with our analysis. The rightmost term, $\\frac{2ab}{a - b}$, is the quotient of two positive quantities and it is decreasing in $a - b$, because the numerator, $2ab$, is constant and the denominator, $a - b$, is increasing in $a$ (for fixed $a b = 8$ ), so this term attains its minimum value as $a - b$ gets larger and larger. Based on this observation, we see that our expression, $a - b + \\frac{2ab}{a - b}$, is increasing in $a - b$. Thus, we should try to make $a - b$ as small as possible in order to minimize our expression. \n\nRound 4: \nMinimizing $a - b$ is equivalent to maximizing $b$, subject to the constraint $ab = 8$. This is a straightforward optimization problem, where we can write $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = \\frac{8}{a}$ and then find $\\frac{db}{da}$ and check where the derivative is zero. However, it is quite evident that positivity of $a$ and $b$ enforces that $b$ would be maximized when $a$ is minimized.

If we re-inspect our terms, we find that the problematic term is $\\frac{2ab}{a - b}$ and it becomes undefined if $a = b$. So, we cannot have $a = b$. The best way to minimize $a - b$ is then to make $a$ as close to $b$ as possible without letting them be equal; in other words, to \"let $a$ approach $b$ from the right.\"\n\nRound 6:  \nWe now know that, given $ab = 8$, the expression is minimized when $a$ is as close as possible to $b$ without actually being equal to $b$.

The benefit of the second approach is that it becomes clearer that $a^2 + b^2$ is the combination of the square of $a - b$ and $2ab$.

Optimally we would choose $a = b$, which would theoretically minimize this value. However, we cannot choose $a = b$ as it's given that $a > b$ and this would also make the denominator zero. \n\nStep 4: \nWe have a constraint from the information given in the problem that $ab = 8$.
