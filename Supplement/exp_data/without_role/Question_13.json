We can calculate the revenue as the product of the number of sales and the price per unit.\n\nLet R be the revenue function, then: \n\nR(d) = (450 - 5d)(500 + 10d) = 225000 - 2500d + 5000d - 50d^2 = -50d^2 + 2500d + 225000\n\nRound 2.\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to take the derivative of the revenue function, and set it to zero, then solve for $d$.\n\nR'(d) = -100d + 2500 = 0, which gives d = 25.\n\nRound 3.\nSo, the price decreases by $25$ times $5$, i.e., $125$.

The revenue (R) can be calculated by the number of smartphones sold (x) times the price per smartphone (p).\n\nAssistant 2: That's right! But let's represent the number of smartphones and the price per smartphone in terms of variables that can change due to market conditions, such as the decrease in price and the increase in sales. \n\nAssistant 1: Sure, we're told that a decrease of $5 in price results in an increase of 10 smartphones sold. So we can represent the number of smartphones sold per week as '500 + 10d', where 'd' represents the number of $5 decreases. \n\nAssistant 2: Similarly, we can represent the price of each smartphone as '450 - 5d', since each decrease of $5 brings the price down from the original $450.\n\nAssistant 1: With these expressions, we can then write the revenue R as a function of 'd': R(d) = (500 + 10d)*(450 - 5d).\n\nAssistant 2: To find the price that maximizes revenue, we can now take the derivative of R(d) with respect to 'd', set it to zero, and solve for 'd'. \n\nAssistant 1: The derivative of R(d) is R'(d) = 5000 - 100d.\n\nAssistant 2: Setting this to zero and solving for 'd' gives us the value at which we maximize revenue: d = 50.\n\nAssistant 1: This means we have to decrease the price by $5, 50 times, so the new price is $450 - 5*50 = $200.\n\nAssistant 2: And a quick second derivative test (R''(d) = -100) shows that this is indeed a maximum.\n\nAssistant 1:\\boxed{200}", "round 1": "Round 1: Formulating the Revenue Function\nThe revenue function can be expressed as the product of quantity and price.

The correct expansion should be R(d) = 225000 +2500d -50d\u00b2.\n\nRound 2: Next, we need to calculate the first derivative, which helps us to determine the optimal number of price drops.
