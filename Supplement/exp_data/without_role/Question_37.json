Euler's theorem states that if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi(n)$ denotes Euler's totient function.\n\nApplying Euler\u2019s theorem in this case, and focusing specifically on calculating the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo $11^2$, if we set $a=2$ and $n=11^2$, the theorem becomes $2^{\\phi(11^2)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11^2}$.\n\nNext, the totient of $11^2$ needs to be calculated.

However, to generate the desired $2*b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11^2}$, the exponent of $2$ could also be $110 - 1 = 109$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is the power of $2$, which is $109 \\pmod{11^2}$. Since $109 \\equiv 109 \\pmod{11^2}$ (as $109 < 11^2$), the final answer is $\\boxed{109}$.

However, this interpretation isn't fully accurate. If $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$ isn't necessarily $a^{\\phi(n) - 1}$, as implied in my solution.\n\nThe correct approach typically involves finding $k$ in $ak \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.

Therefore their cycle frequency of 45 is incorrect.\n\nAgent 1 uses Hensel's Lemma for lifting and finds the result to be 1.
