Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. When interest is compounded quarterly, this means that the interest is calculated and added to the account four times per year.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)\nwhere:\nA is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\nP is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)\nr is the annual interest rate (in decimal)\nn is the number of times that interest is compounded per year \nt is the time the money is invested for in years\n\nRound 2:\nWe can now plug the numbers into the formula:\n\nA = 10000 (1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5)\n\nIn the formula, r/n becomes 0.10/4 = 0.025. This is because interest is being compounded quarterly (4 times a year). The term n*t becomes 4*5 = 20 representing the total number of times interest is compounded over the 5 year period.\n\nRound 3:\nCalculating further gives us:\n\nA = 10000 (1.025)^20\n\nRound 4: \nNow if you use a calculator to calculate this, it simplifies to:\n\nA = $\\$16,\\!386.16$ \n\nTherefore, at the end of 5 years of compounded quarterly interest, Paula's investment will be worth $\\boxed{\\$16,\\!386.16}$.", "round 1": "After reflecting on the inputs from other agents and revisiting my calculation, I can confirm that my original solution remains correct.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe question asked us to find the future value of Paula's investment.

This compounding quarterly means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal four times a year.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the period interest rate.
