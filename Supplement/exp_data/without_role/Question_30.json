Let's rearrange this to $ab=13k+6abc-(bc+ca)$. Since $13|2ab+bc+ca$, we can substitute $2ab+bc+ca$ with $13n$ for some integer $n$. Thus, we obtain $ab=13(k-n)+6abc$.\n\nRound 3: Similarly, considering the third congruence $ab+bc+2ca\\equiv 8abc\\pmod{13}$, we obtain $ab+bc=13l+8abc-2ca$ where $l$ is an integer. Knowing $2ab+bc+ca=13m$ for some integer $m$, we can replace $2ab+bc$ with $13m-ca$ to get $ab+13m-ca=13l+8abc-2ca$. Simplifying this gives $ab=13(l-m)+8abc+ca$.\n\nRound 4: Now, we know $ab=13(k-n)+6abc$ and $ab=13(l-m)+8abc+ca$. Setting these equal to each other, we get\n$13(k-n)+6abc=13(l-m)+8abc+ca$.

Similarly, subtracting equation (3) from equation (1) yields $ac - ab \\equiv 8abc \\pmod {13}$. By comparing these two results, it's evident that $bc \\equiv ac \\pmod{13}$, implying $b \\equiv c \\pmod{13}$. Similarly, it can be shown that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{13}$ and therefore $a \\equiv b \\equiv c \\pmod{13}$.\n\nReturning to the original equations, it's now clear that if we replace $b$ and $c$ with $a$ in the original equations, we can reduce them to:\n\n\\[4a^2 \\equiv 0\\pmod {13} \\tag{1}\\]\n\\[4a^2 \\equiv 6a^3\\pmod {13} \\tag{2}\\]\n\\[4a^2 \\equiv 8a^3\\pmod {13} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nSimplifying these gives parallel equations $a^2\\equiv 0,2,4 \\pmod {13}$. As $a$ is a positive integer less than 13, the values that satisfy these equations are $a=0,1,\\ldots,12$. Given $a$ must be positive, the only solution is $a=1$.\n\nGiven $a=b=c$, we have $a+b+c=3a=3$, and finally we find that the remainder when $a+b+c$ is divided by $13$ is \\boxed{3}."}]}
