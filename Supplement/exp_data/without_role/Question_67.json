We have all the angles for these triangles, which would allow us to utilize trigonometric ratios to find the missing side which is labelled 'x'.\n\nRound 2:\nStarting with the left triangle, we first note that it is a 30-60-90 triangle. Here, the hypotenuse is 2, and we want to figure out the side opposite the 60-degree angle, which by convention is labeled 'x'.

We can use the properties of right triangles and the values of the trigonometric ratios of some special angles to find the length of $x$.\n\nRound 2: Developing a Strategy\nIn the smaller triangle on the left, we are given that the angle at the vertex where the two hypotenuses meet is $60^{\\circ}$. This means the other acute angle is $30^{\\circ}$, creating a $30-60-90$ triangle. This is a special type of triangle, where the sides form ratios. Specifically, the side across from the $30^{\\circ}$ angle is half the hypotenuse. \n\nIn the larger triangle on the right, we are given that the angle at the vertex where the two hypotenuses meet is $45^{\\circ}$. This means that the other acute angle is also $45^{\\circ}$, creating a $45-45-90$ triangle. This is another special triangle where the sides across from the $45^{\\circ}$ angles are equal to each other and each is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the hypotenuse. \n\nRound 3: Calculating x\nIn the left triangle, we know that the length of the side across from the $30^{\\circ}$ angle (which is $x$) is half the length of the hypotenuse, which is $2$. Thus, we know that $x = 2\\div2 = 1$. \n\nIn the right triangle, the length of the side across from the $45^{\\circ}$ angle (which is also $x$) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse.

Therefore, we are confident that this is the correct answer. The result is already in the simplest form. \n\nHence, \\boxed{x=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}.", "round 1": "Round 1: Identifying Key Concepts\nTaking note of the information given, there are two right-angled triangles. We have a 45-45-90 triangle where the side opposite the 45-degree angle is the same as the side adjacent to it, which is x. And the other triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle where the hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite the 30 degrees angle.\n\nRound 2: Creating an Equation using trigonometric ratios\nSince we have all the angles for these triangles, we could use the sine, cosine, or tangent to solve for x. We would find the associated ratio with the 60 degrees angle in the left triangle and the 45 degrees angle in the right triangle. This could give us potential equations for x.\n\nRound 3: Calculating x\nThe sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse. So if we apply such principle to some ratios for the 60 degrees angle in the 30-60-90 triangle, we can get the length of the side opposite this angle. And so: sin(60) = x / 2\nThis gives us x = 2 sin(60) = 2 * (\u221a3/2) = \u221a3.\n\nAlso, we know that the side opposite the 45 degrees angle in the right triangle should be x and since tan(45) = 1 (which is the ratio of the side opposite the 45 degrees angle to the side adjacent to the 45 degrees angle), x = x tan(45). Therefore x should be equal to x.\n\nRound 4: Checking Results\nBoth of the angles give us different results for x, \u221a3 and x respectively, which means a mistake has been made somewhere. We need to find which of the two values is the correct one. \n\nUpon second thought, in the 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse should be \u221a2 times the length of a leg. In this diagram, the hypotenuse (the side labelled '2') is longer than the leg (the side labelled 'x'), but sqrt(2) is a number between 1 and 2, not 2 itself. So in the 45-45-90 triangle it means that x equals 2 divided by \u221a2 after applying the property that the length of the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg. Simplifying we get that x is equal sqrt(2).\n\nThe calculation for x in the 30-60-90 triangle was wrong. The side opposite to 60 degrees in a 30-60-90 triangle is (\u221a3)/2 times the hypotenuse. So x = (\u221a3)/2 * 2 = \u221a3. That was correct but what I had wrong was the association, x should be associated with the side opposite the 30 degrees angle because that's half the hypotenuse in a 30-60-90 triangle. So x = 2 / 2 = 1. \n\nRound 5: Confirming the result\nWe got that x equals sqrt(2) from the 45-45-90 triangle and 1 from the 30-60-90 triangle. Both should equal the same x.

Here is a simplified way to look at these two triangles:\n\nFor a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees respectively is 1 : \u221a3 : 2. \nFor a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides opposite each 45 degree angle are equal and each is \u221a2 times the leg. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nStarting with the 30-60-90 triangle: \n\nGiven that the hypotenuse is 2 (the side opposite the 90\u00b0 angle), the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle (which we marked as x) would be \u221a3 times the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle. However, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is always 1/2 the hypotenuse. So, the side marked as x should actually be 1, which is half of the hypotenuse.\n\nNow let's look at the 45-45-90 triangle: \n\nIn this triangle, one leg (opposite the 45\u00b0 angle) is marked as x. For a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg. If x=1, then the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times 1, which equals \u221a2. This agrees with the length of the hypotenuse in the left triangle, which should be shorter than the side labelled '2'.\n\nVerifying our results, the hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle is twice the length of the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle. So it should indeed be 2 in this case since x equals 1. Similarly, in the 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg, so in this case, it should be \u221a2, which is less than 2.
