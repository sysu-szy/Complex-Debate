After $5$, we have the numbers $16$, $8$, $4$, $2$, and $1$, which loop back to $4$. Therefore, when we start from $14$, we go through $14$ different integers before it starts to loop indefinitely.

Now we proceed by looking at the follow-up values generated by the function. Because $f(a) = b$ lets us define $f(b)$, we can see that $f(7) = 3(7) + 1 = 22$ since 7 is odd. Then, using the even rule, $f(22) = \\frac{22}{2} = 11$ because 22 is even. Now we follow the same process for 11: $f(11) = 3(11) + 1 = 34$ and then $f(34) = \\frac{34}{2} = 17$. Hence up till now the domain of $f$ are the numbers $14, 7, 22, 11$ and $34$.\n\nRound 2:\n\nWe continue this process with 17, noting that $f(17) = 3(17) + 1 = 52$ and $f(52) = \\frac{52}{2} = 26$.

Then, $f(8) = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$, $f(4) = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$ and finally $f(2) = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$. With the number 1, $f(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4$.
