So, $A$ can be expressed as a sum of areas of circles with even radii:\n$A = \\pi (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + ... + 100^2)$. But we know generally that the sum of squares till $n$ is given by $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$. \n\nRound 2: So, applying it to our equation: $A = \\pi \\cdot 2^2(1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 50^2)$.

To calculate the total area of the green circles, we add up the areas of the individual circles: \n$A = \\pi (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + ... + 100^2)$.\n\nRound 2:\nThe formula for the sum of squares of first n numbers is $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$.

The phrase \"...each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color...\" seems to point to the latter interpretation. This would mean that the green regions are effectively the difference in area between consecutive circles starting with the second one (radius 2).\n\nRound 1:\nIf we consider every circle starting from radius 2 up to 100, we note that the green regions would be represented by differences in areas between even and odd radii:\n\n$\\pi(2^2-1^2) + \\pi(4^2-3^2) + \\pi(6^2-5^2) + ... +\\pi(100^2-99^2)$\n\nSimplifying, this becomes \n\n$\\pi(3 + 7 + 11 + ... + 199)$\n\nThis progression has a common difference of 4. \n\nRound 2:\nThe sum of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n$S = n/2 * (a + l)$\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of terms\n- a is the first term\n- l is the last term\n\nHere, we have 50 terms with the first term being 3 and the last term being 199.

As we know, the area of a circle is given by the function of its radius squared, or $A = \u03c0r^2$.

This means that the region between the first and second circles is green, the region between the second and third is red, etc. Therefore, the region between the nth and (n+1)th circles is red if n is even and green if n is odd.\n\nRound 3:\nWe need to find the total area of the green regions. This is the sum of the areas of the odd-numbered circles minus the areas of the even-numbered circles directly inside them. This can be expressed as the sum $(4\u03c0 - \u03c0) + (16\u03c0 - 9\u03c0) + ... + (10000\u03c0 - 9801\u03c0)$ which simplifies to $3\u03c0 + 7\u03c0 + ... + 199\u03c0$. \n\nRound 4:\nAs we can see, this forms an arithmetic series from 3 to 199 inclusive, with a common difference of 4. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, $S_n = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d]$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. Here, $n = 50$, $a = 3$ and $d = 4$.

The radius of the bigger circle is 100, so the area is $\u03c0\u22c5100^2 = 10000\u03c0$. Hence, the ratio becomes $50 \u22c5 99/10000$ which simplifies to $99/200$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers is $99/200$.

Some agents concluded that the sequence of green region areas would consist of areas with radii 2, 4, 6, ..., 100, while others argue that the sequence would rather be defined by the differences in the areas between consecutive circles.\n\nMy own interpretation as presented in the previous discussion also corresponds to the latter approach \u2013 the green region areas are derived from the difference between the areas of consecutive circles. The reason behind this interpretation is the phrase in the problem: \"each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green.\" The term 'region' should be interpreted as the ring or annulus between two consecutive circles and not the area of the larger circle itself.\n\nTherefore, I stick with my interpretation and calculating the total area of green regions as the sum of areas resulting from differences of even and odd indexed circles.

The area of the biggest circle (with radius $100$) is $100^2\\pi = 10000\\pi$.\n\nThe ratio of these two areas is hence $\\frac{(50\\pi \\cdot 99)}{(10000\\pi)}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{99}{200}$.\n\nThus, the ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius $100$ can be expressed as $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and the solution comes out to be $m+n = 99+200 = \\boxed{299}$.", "round 2": "Reviewing all the solutions, there seems to be a discrepancy regarding the calculation of the total area of the green regions. The different interpretations of the problem revolve around how we calculate the area of 'each region bounded by consecutive circles'.

We are looking for the difference in areas between two successive circles, which is easier to calculate if we consider the area of annulus formed by two successive circles. Looking at how the circles are arranged, we can deduce that the area of each green region is indeed given by $\u03c0(2r-1)$ where r is the radius of the outer circle of the green region.\n\nWe thus have a sequence of the areas of the green regions starting from the one with smallest outer radius: $\u03c0(3), \u03c0(7), \u03c0(11), ..., \u03c0(199)$. We can see that this is an arithmetic sequence with the first term, $a_1 = 3$, the last term $a_{50} = 199$, and the common difference $d = 4$.\n\nWe can now calculate the total green area by summing the sequence: \n\n$Total\\ Green\\ Area = \u03c0[3 + 7 + 11 + ... + 199]$\n\nThis is a sum of an arithmetic series which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of arithmetic series: $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ where n is the number of terms which here is 50.\n\n$Total\\ Green\\ Area = \u03c0 \\cdot \\frac{50}{2} (3 + 199) = 5050\u03c0$\n\nThe area of the largest circle with radius 100 is $\u03c0r^2 = 10000\u03c0$.\n\nSo, the ratio of the total green area to the total area of the largest circle is:\n\n$\\frac{Total\\ Green\\ Area}{Total\\ circle\\ area} = \\frac{5050\u03c0}{10000\u03c0} = \\frac{5050}{10000} = \\frac{505}{2000} = \\frac{101}{400}$.\n\nAs such, the ratio of these two areas can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, which gives us $101$ and $400$ respectively.\n\nThis yields the final answer of $m + n = 101 + 400 = \\boxed{501}$.
