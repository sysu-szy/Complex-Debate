{"question": "Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$?", "answer": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\\cdot 6$, $3\\cdot 4$, and $2\\cdot2\\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\\{11\\}$, $\\{5,1\\}$, $\\{3,2\\}$, and $\\{2,1,1\\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\\ldots$.

Additionally, we know that the product of all divisors of n is $n^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors. For our problem, this means that $n^6 = n^{d/2}$, and from here, we can see that $d/2 = 6$, or $d = 12$.

Keep in mind that the quantity of divisors is affected by incrementing the exponents in the prime factorization (For example, if $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...p_k^{e_k}$, then the number of divisors $d = (e_1+1)(e_2+1)...(e_k+1)$. This can be visualized by considering how each prime factor can be included from 0 to $e_i$ times in any divisor.)\n\nRound 4: \nIn order to minimize $n$, we should use the smallest primes possible in its prime factorization. Hence, we take $n=2^{11}$ as $n$, as this gives us exactly 12 divisors ($e+1 = 11+1 = 12$) and $n$ is as small as possible. But $2^{11}$ is a large number and we can decrease $n$ by using more exponents.\n\nRound 5: \nIndeed, since we need $d = 12$, we can achieve that with a smaller $n$ if we use more exponents.
