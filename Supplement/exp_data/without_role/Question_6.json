By not using the characteristic equation solving method, I instead looked for a pattern between the given values. I found that the difference between $f(n)$ and $f(n-1)$ increases by 1 for each decrease by 1 in $n$. Because of this, I defined a difference $d(n) = f(n) - f(n-1)$.

This is indeed reminiscent of a Fibonacci-like sequence, but it's different in that the previous term is additive, rather than subtracted.\n\nUpon making the sequence $f_n = f(n)$, we can see the relationship as $f_n = f_{n+1} + f_{n-1}$, which is a linear relationship. \n\nNow, with the given initial values $f_{15} = 20$ and $f_{20} = 15$, a linear pattern can be derived: For every 5 steps, the value of the function decreases by 5 points. Therefore, if we know the value of the function at certain points, we can predict the value at other points on the line.\n\nWhat is necessary here, however, is a correct application of the pattern. Looking at the solution from Agent 2, there is a valid argument that each 5 step interval contributes to a tenfold decrease.

Given \\(f(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x - 1)\\) implies \\(f(x + 1) - f(x) = f(x) - f(x - 1)\\) by subtraction. We can define a new function \\(g(x) = f(x + 1) - f(x)\\), then by the equation \\(g(x) = g(x - 1)\\), meaning g(x) is constant. Then, with initial values \\(f(15) = 20\\) and \\(f(20)=15\\), we can compute \\(g(15) = f(16) - f(15)\\), and \\(g(16) = f(17) - f(16) = g(15)\\), we must have \\(f(16) = f(15) + g(15)\\), so \\(f(16) = f(15)\\). Similarly, \\(f(17) = f(16)\\), ..., \\(f(20) = f(19)\\). So, \\(f(20) = f(15)\\), which is \\(f(20) = 20\\) rather than \\(f(20) = 15\\). Therefore, \\(g(15) = 0\\), so \\(f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0\\) also for all integer \\(x\\), so \\(f(x)\\) is also constant. Therefore, \\(f(20152015) = f(15) = \\boxed{20}\\).", "round 2": "After re-evaluating the functional equation, the approaches of other agents and my initial conclusion, there seems to be a pattern that the function consistently decreases by 5 for every five-unit increment or decrement in x. This is well-demonstrated by Agent 2's approach, highlighting a crucial insight in the series.\n\nGiven function, $f(x) = f(x + 1) + f(x - 1)$, and information $f(15) = 20$ and $f(20) = 15$. In simpler terms, the function decreases by 1 for every increase of 1 in x.\n\nApplying this logic, moving from $x = 15$ to $x = 20$, incrementing five steps, $f(20) = f(15) - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15$. This validates the given information and confirms the identified pattern.\n\nNow, moving from $x = 20$ to $x = 20152015$, it covers 20151995 steps. The number of five-step intervals in these steps is $\\frac{20151995}{5} = 4030399$. \n\nSo, the function will decrease by $5 \\times 4030399 = 20151995$ units, moving from $x = 20$ to $x = 20152015$. \n\nTherefore, the function's value at $x = 20152015$ will be: $f(20152015) = f(20) - 20151995 = 15 - 20151995$.\n\nThis yields $f(20152015) = -20151980$.\n\nHence, the revised conclusion for the problem is $f(20152015) = \\boxed{-20151980}$."}]}
