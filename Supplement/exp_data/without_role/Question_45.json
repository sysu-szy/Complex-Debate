Since $\\tan 7x$ and $\\cot 7x$ are basically reciprocals, I can combine them to have $\\frac{\\sin^2 7x + \\cos^2 7x}{\\sin 7x \\cos 7x}$ on the left. This simplifies to be $\\frac{1}{\\sin 7x \\cos 7x}$. On the other hand, I can represent $\\sin 6x$ and $\\cos 4x$ as $2 \\sin 3x \\cos 2x$. \n\nNow, the equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\sin 7x \\cos 7x} = 2 \\sin 3x \\cos 2x$\n\nNext, I will use the formula for $\\cos(a-b)$ which is $\\cos a \\cos b + \\sin a \\sin b$ and simplify to arrive at $\\sin 7x \\cos 7x = 2 \\sin x(1 - 2 \\sin^2 x)$. \n\nSetting each factors to 0 and solving for x between [0, $\\pi$] will give us the solutions to the equation. \n\nSetting $2 \\sin x(1 - 2 \\sin^2 x)$ to 0, the solutions are $x = 0, \\pi$.\n\nSetting $\\sin 7x \\cos 7x$ to 0, the solutions are $x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{2\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{14}, \\frac{3\\pi}{14}, \\frac{5\\pi}{14}, \\frac{7\\pi}{14}, \\frac{9\\pi}{14}, \\frac{11\\pi}{14}$.\n\nTherefore, the solutions common to both equations are $x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi$. \n\nHence, the solutions to the given equation are \\boxed{x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi}.", "round 2": "Upon reconsidering the solutions provided by several agents, and carefully re-analyzing my previous approach, I now realize that I overlooked some critical aspects. \n\nIn the derivation where I equated $1/ (\\sin 7x \\cos 7x)$ to $2 \\sin 3x \\cos 2x$, the path to the final equation was correct but a mistake was made when I equated each of the expressions to 0. Instead of assuming that each part separately being zero will lead to the solution, I should have taken them together as one equation and then solved. \n\nTaking this into consideration, my equation, $1/ (\\sin 7x \\cos 7x)$ = $2 \\sin 3x \\cos 2x$, is valid but needs a different approach to solve.\n\nBy leveraging both $\\sin^2 a + \\cos^2 a = 1$ and using $\\sin 2a = 2\\sin a\\cos a$ will lead to the following equation : \n\n$2 \\sin 7x \\cos 7x = 2(1 - 2\\sin^2 3x) \\sin 2x$\n\nwhich simplifies to :\n\n$\\sin 14x = 2\\sin 2x - 4\\sin^3 2x$\n\nAt this point the equation has become a bit complex, but can be solved with determined patience and a logical analysis of the structure of the equation. Here, we can convert the cubic equation into a quadratic by letting $y = \\sin 2x$ which results in: \n\n$2y - 4y^3 = \\sin 14x$\n\nGiven that the left-hand side of equation has three roots in [-1,1], namely -1, 0, 1, and these must be equal to $\\sin 14x$, it is possible that x has 14 roots in total by checking the periodicity of the functions.\n\nSo, we substitute $y$ back to get $x = \\arcsin y/2$ or $x = \\pi - \\arcsin y/2$ which are the roots of the given equation. Substituting $y$ with -1, 0, 1. We can find the following roots:\n\n$x = 0, \\pi, \\frac{2\\pi}{14}, \\frac{4\\pi}{14}, \\frac{6\\pi}{14}, \\frac{10\\pi}{14}, \\frac{12\\pi}{14}, \\pi + \\frac{2\\pi}{14}, \\pi + \\frac{4\\pi}{14}, \\pi + \\frac{6\\pi}{14}, 2\\pi + \\frac{10\\pi}{14}, 2\\pi + \\frac{12\\pi}{14}$\n\nCalculating the inverse sine for these roots we lead to the following solutions for x in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$:\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the given equation are \\boxed{x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{7}, \\frac{2\\pi}{7}, \\frac{3\\pi}{7}, \\frac{4\\pi}{7}, \\pi, \\frac{8\\pi}{7}, \\frac{9\\pi}{7}, \\frac{10\\pi}{7}, \\frac{11\\pi}{7}, \\frac{12\\pi}{7}, \\frac{13\\pi}{7}, 2\\pi}."}]}
