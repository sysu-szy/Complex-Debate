All agents are in agreement that you have to abridge and apply the given formula: 1/2 * slant height * (sum of the circumferences of the two circular faces). The disagreement is rather in the calculation of the slant height, $L$. My solution calculation for $L$ relied on the Pythagorean Theorem with the two values being the radius of the smaller circle subtracted from the radius of the larger circle (to get the horizontal leg of the triangle) and the height of the frustum (for the vertical leg of the triangle). Agent solution 0 and Agent solution 2 didn't take into account that the diagonal (the slant height) is created by the difference in terms of radius and the height of the frustum, not the total radius. From there, the circumference of each circle is calculated and then applied to the established formula.\n\nAlso, there's consensus for the process to find the areas of the two faces of the frustum. This is a straightforward application of the formula for the area of a circle ($\\pi r^2$) for each face independently.

We get the slant height as $L = \\sqrt{(10-4)^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$ cm.\n\nThen, taking the circumference of the smaller face (with radius 4 cm) as $2\\pi(4)=8\\pi$ cm and the circumference of the larger face (with radius 10 cm) as $2\\pi(10)=20\\pi$ cm, we can now find the lateral surface area.

The top face has radius 4 cm and thus an area of $\\pi(4)^2 = 16\\pi$ square centimeters.
