The height of the tetrahedron is not the same as the height of one of the triangular faces; it is actually the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex of the tetrahedron.\n\nWe started off correctly by considering the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from a vertex of the base triangle to its midpoint.

To find the height of the tetrahedron, we need to consider the right triangle formed by the apex of the tetrahedron, the centroid of the base triangle, and any vertex of the base triangle - a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 1, one leg of length 'a' and the tetrahedron height as the other leg.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the height of the tetrahedron is found to be $\\sqrt{1 - a^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the tetrahedron as $V=\\frac{1}{3} * A * h = \\frac{1}{3} * \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} * \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}$.\n\nFinally, the square of the volume is $V^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{576}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{192}}$.\n\nSo, upon careful re-evaluation, the exact value of $V^2$ for a regular tetrahedron with side length 1 is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{192}}."}, {"round 0": "Speaker 1: First, let's recall some basic concepts.

We used the formula V = (1/6)*a\u00b2h, where a is the side length, and h is the equilateral triangle's height.\n\nSpeaker 2: The height of the equilateral triangle, calculated using Pythagoras' theorem in a 30-60-90 triangle, was \u221a3/2.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thus, the regular tetrahedron's volume was V = (1/6)*(1)^2*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3/12.\n\nSpeaker 2: Finally, we squared this volume to get V\u00b2 = [\u221a3/12]\u00b2 = 3/144 = 1/48.\n\nI believed our calculation to be correct then, but I'll revisit it now in light of the alternative solutions.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, I believe we made a mistake in calculating the regular tetrahedron's height. While the height of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is indeed \u221a3/2, the height (sometimes called the 'altitude') of the regular tetrahedron is not the same as the height of one of its faces. The tetrahedron's height is the line drawn from one vertex perpendicular to the opposite face (center). \n\nGiven the tetrahedron's symmetry, this line splits the tetrahedron into two smaller, right tetrahedrons. Now, if we drop a line from the vertex of the equilateral base triangle right down to its center, we have a right triangle within the right tetrahedron. One side of this triangle is the tetrahedron's height, one side is \u221a3/2 (the height of the base triangle, as previously calculated), and the hypotenuse is 1 (the length of the side of the tetrahedron).\n\nUsing Pythagoras' theorem, we find the tetrahedron's height to be \u221a(1\u00b2 - (\u221a3/2)\u00b2) = \u221a(1 - 3/4) = \u221a1/4 = 1/2. With this corrected height, we can recalculate the volume of the tetrahedron as V = (1/3) * (\u221a3/4) * 1/2 = \u221a3/24.

Then, I correctly pointed out that the height of the tetrahedron is different from the height of its triangular faces. \n\nThe height of a regular tetrahedron is the line drawn from one vertex perpendicular to the face it touches. This is not the same as the height of one of the equilateral triangles that make up the tetrahedron's faces. Considering the symmetry of a tetrahedron, this altitude cuts it into two identical right-angled tetrahedra. \n\nSpeaking of right-angled triangles, one of which is embedded in the right-angled tetrahedron: its hypotenuse is the original tetrahedron's side (i.e., 1), one side is the height of one of the equilateral triangle faces (i.e., $\\sqrt{3}/2$), and the other side is the height of the tetrahedron.

As such, every edge of the tetrahedron has an equal length and every face is an equilateral triangle. \n\nRound 2: Finding the Height of the Tetrahedron \n\nStart by focusing on any one face of the tetrahedron, which is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1. From the apex of the tetrahedron, there is a line perpendicular to this face that meets at its center. This line can be considered as the height (h) of the tetrahedron. \n\nTo find the height of the tetrahedron, we must first find the height of the equilateral triangle face.

The height (a) of one of the equilateral triangle faces forms a 30-60-90 degree triangle with one side of the triangle and a line drawn from that side's midpoint to the opposite vertex. Thus, by the properties of 30-60-90 triangles, we have a = (1/2)*sqrt(3), where 1 is the side length of the equilateral triangle face.\n\n3.
