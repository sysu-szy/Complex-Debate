The equation for AB is y = 2x because point A lies on the parabola y = x\u00b2 which has a derivative of 2x at every point (the derivative is the slope of the tangent line at that point). Using the point-slope form of a line, and since A lies on the y-axis, the y-intercept is 0. Thus, the equation of AB is y = 2x. For BC, since AB and BC are perpendicular, the slope of BC is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB, so m = -1/2. B lies on the line AB, so the y-intercept will be the y-coordinate of B, which is 2x. Thus, the equation of BC is y = -1/2x + 2x. \n\nRound 2: \nSince BC is a vertical translation of the line y = -1/2x and passes through point C which lies on y = x\u00b2, we solve for x by setting y = x\u00b2  equal to -1/2x + 2x . Simplify to x=2 or x=-1 meaning that the x coordinates of B and C are either 2 or -1. Therefore, we get two different lines for BC y = -1/2x + 4 and y = -1/2x -1 which pass through points B and C.\n\nRound 3: \nThe equation of the parabola that vertex B lies on can now be found by eliminating x from the two equations: y = 2x (the equation of AB that is known to pass through B) and y = -1/2x + 4, y = -1/2x -1 (the two potential equations for BC). Setting these equal gives 2x = -1/2x + 4 and 2x = -1/2x -1. Solving for x gives x = 2/5, x = -1/5.\n\nRound 4: \nSubstitute x values back into the equation y = 2x to get y coordinates of B : y = 4/5, y = -2/5.\n\nRound 5:\nSince the coordinates of B (x, y) satisfy the equation y = x^2 , we can substitute x as y/2 into the equation and simplify to get the equation of the parabola y lies on as : y = (y/2)^2 .

Therefore, B has coordinates (-a,a^2).\n\nRound 3:\nAs we're looking for a parabola in the form y = px^2 + qx + r on which B lies, we have to substitute x and y with -a and a^2 respectively.

This is because A and C are equidistant from the y-axis and lie on the parabola.\n\nStep 2:\nGiven that OA and OC are parallel to the axes and OABC is a rectangle, we can deduce that point B is also equidistant from the y-axis as is O from A and C. Hence, B must always lie on the y-axis. As OB = OC, point B must be (0, a^2).\n\nStep 3:\nWe then substitute this point into the general equation y = px^2 + qx + r, to find the constants for the parabola on which B lies. Given that x = 0, the equation reduces to r = a^2.\n\nStep 4:\nSince a can take any positive or negative value, a^2 (which is r) spans all non-negative values. Unlike a parabola whose vertex is a concrete point, B has no fixed x-coordinate because r could be any non-negative number.\n\nHence, the parabola equation becomes y = 0*x^2 + 0*x + r which simplifies to y = r where r is any non-negative real number. This indicates that B can be anywhere on the y-axis above the origin (inclusively).\n\nSo, the solution here is \\boxed{y = r, r \\ge 0}."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: \nLet's start by writing down the coordinates for the points $A$ and $C$. Since they lie on the parabola $y=x^2$, their coordinates must be of the form $A=(a,a^2)$ and $C=(-a,a^2)$. We can find these from the symmetry of the parabola around the $y$-axis.\n\nRound 2: \nSince $OABC$ is a rectangle, then $OB$ is a diagonal of the rectangle which means $B$ is the midpoint of $AC$. We can easily find the coordinates for $B$ using the midpoint formula.\n\nRound 3: \nThe midpoint of two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by the formula $\\left( \\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2} \\right)$. So the coordinates for $B$ are $\\left( \\frac{a+(-a)}{2},\\frac{a^2+a^2}{2} \\right)$.\n\nRound 4: \nWe can simplify this to get the coordinates for $B$ as $B = \\left(0, a^2\\right)$. This is true for any value of $a$, meaning $B$ can be any point on the positive part of the $y$-axis. \n\nConclusion: \nSince there is no $x$ in our coordinate for $B$ and the $y$ coordinate is the square of $a$, that means $B$ is lying on the parabola $y = 0x^2 + 0x + a^2$. However, this equation is not fixed, and we are looking for a fixed parabola. But we see that for every point on the line $y = a^2$, there is some $a$ value which will yield this result, so every positive $y$ coordinate $(0,y)$ for $y>a^2$ will have some corresponding $a$ such that it lands on this line. Therefore, for any $B=(0,y)$, the rectangle OABC can be drawn such that $A$ and $C$ are on the parabola $y = x^2$.

In a rectangle opposite sides have equal length, not the diagonals.
