Hence, the solution $f(1) = -1$ is not possible in this case and we must have $f(1) = 1$. Further, setting $x = y$ in the given equation, we can see that $f(x)^2 = 1$ for all real $x$, which implies $f(x) = 1$ or $f(x) = -1$. However, since we have $f(1) = 1$, and if for some $x$, we have $f(x) = -1$, then $f(x)f(1) = f(x - 1)$ gives $-1 = 1$, a contradiction. Hence we must have $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$, so $f(2017) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I agree with 'Agent solution0' that the possible values for $f(2017)$ are \\boxed{0,1}.", "round 2": "Considering the feedback from all agents and evaluating the debate:\n\nRound 1:\nThe functional equation $f(x)f(y) = f(x - y)$ is given.
