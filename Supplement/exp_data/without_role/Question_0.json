Also, careful simplification when calculating the system of equations ensured the accurate values of p and q were found. \n\nAlso, looking at the discussion from the other agents, it can be observed that some discussions leaned towards the right direction in some aspect, however there were key errors that took the solution off course. Agent 0 didn't properly analyze the implication of the inverse function. Agent 1 made an algebraic error when subtracting the equations in round 6. Agent 2's discussion, while logically sound, also featured calculation errors.", "round 2": "Looking at my steps from the last solutions and the solutions of other agents, let's adjust the steps in obtaining the solutions:\n\nStep 1:\nWe are given the point (7, -22) lies on the graph of y = f(x), so we plug these values into the equation for f(x):\n\\[-22 = \\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3}.\\]\n\nStep 2:\nNext, we need to simplify this equation:\nCross-multiplication gives us: \n\\[-22(-7q + 3) = -7p - 3,\\]\nwhich simplifies as \\[154q - 66 = 7p + 3.\\]\nRearrange this to a more standard linear equation form, we have:\n\\[7p - 154q = -69.\\]\n\nStep 3:\nNow we consider the inverse function. The point (7, -22) is also on the graph of y = g(x), so we have g(-22) = 7 which means that $f^{-1}(-22)=7$. Substituting these values into the equation for y=f(x) to obtain:\n\\[7 = \\frac{22p - 3}{22q + 3}.\\]\n\nStep 4:\nSolving this equation, cross-multiplication gives us: \n\\[7(22q + 3) = 22p - 3\\]\nFurther simplification gives us:\n\\[154q + 21 = 22p - 3.\\]\nRearranging this gives another linear equation:\n\\[22p - 154q = 24.\\]\n\nStep 5:\nWe now have a system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n7p - 154q &= -69, \\\\\n22p - 154q &= 24.\n\\end{align*}\nSolving this system, subtract the first equation from the second to give:\n\\[15p = 93,\\] which gives $p = \\frac{93}{15} = \\frac{31}{5}.$\n\nStep 6:\nSubstitute $p = \\frac{31}{5}$ back into the first equation to get $7p - 154q = -69,$ which simplifies to $q = \\frac{87}{770}.$\n\nStep 7:\nWe're now ready to solve for $p + q,$ which gives: \n\\[\\frac{31}{5} + \\frac{87}{770} = \\boxed{\\frac{185}{77}}.\\]\n\nSo the correct answer is $p + q = \\boxed{\\frac{185}{77}}$. In conclusion, I found my previous mistakes. Particular attention to the inverse function's value and appropriate substitution in the function's equation is key to getting the correct solution. Also, careful solving when dealing with a system of equations ensured the accurate values of p and q were found.\n"}]}
