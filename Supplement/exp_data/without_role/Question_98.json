Let's represent this new reduced error as \u0394p/2. Since the product of the momentum error and the position error remains the same according to the Uncertainty Principle, we can now write the equation as (\u0394p/2)*(\u0394x')=\u210f/4\u03c0, where \u0394x' is the new error in the position.\n\nSpeaker 1: Agree. If we now solve the equation for \u0394x', we find that \u0394x' = 2\u0394x. This means that the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position has been doubled. \n\nSpeaker 2: And to express this increase in the form of a percent, we have to subtract the original error from the new error and then divide by the original error, and multiply that result by 100.
