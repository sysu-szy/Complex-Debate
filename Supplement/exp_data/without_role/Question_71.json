Regardless of where $x$ starts, after applying $f(x)$, it's either going to be in the sub-segment $[0,1/2]$ or the sub-segment $[1/2,1]$. \n\nAnd then when you apply $f(x)$ again, that $[0,1/2]$ sub-segment itself will be divided up similarly into $[0,1/4]$ and $[1/4,1/2]$, and the $[1/2,1]$ sub-segment will be divided up into $[1/2,3/4]$ and $[3/4,1]$. \n\nSo after the second application of $f(x)$, you've divided $[0,1]$ into $4$ parts: $[0,1/4]$, $[1/4,1/2]$, $[1/2,3/4]$ and $[3/4,1]$. \n\nNow, consider what's going to happen when you apply $f(x)$ for a third time. Each of those sub-segments will again be divided into half. So you'll end up with $8$ segments: $[0,1/8]$, $[1/8,1/4]$, $[1/4,3/8]$, $[3/8,1/2]$, $[1/2,5/8]$, $[5/8,3/4]$, $[3/4,7/8]$ and $[7/8,1]$.\n\nDo you observe the pattern now? Each time you apply $f(x)$, you're doubling the number of segments. So if you apply $f(x)$ $2005$ times, you're going to have $2^{2005}$ segments.\n\nNext, recall that we're looking for the number of values of $x$ for which $f^{[2005]}(x)=1/2$. \n\nWhen $f(x)=1/2$, that means $x$ is right in the midpoint of a segment either going from $0$ to $1/2$ or $1/2$ to $1$. \n\nIn other words, we want the number of midpoints of all the segments that were formed after we applied $f(x)$ for $2005$ times. Each segment has exactly one midpoint, so the total number of such $x$ is exactly the number of segments.\n\nSo, the number of values of $x$ that we're looking for is $2^{2005}$.\n\nWe see that this number can be expressed in the form requested, $p^a$, with $p$ as the prime number $2$ and $a$ as the integer $2005$. \n\nSo $p=2$ and $a=2005$, and hence $p+a=2+2005 = \\boxed{2007}$.\n\nThat's our solution.", "round 1": "Indeed, let us re-examine our solution to this problem. We've understood that the function $f(x)$ divides the interval $[0,1]$ into two segments at each step. When applied iteratively, it will divide the interval into $2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of iterations) equal segments. Thus, the function defines a binary tree with the root representing the interval $[0,1]$, and each node having two child nodes that represent the two respective sub-segments. \n\nThe end nodes at the $n$-th level of the tree represent the $2^n$ segments after $n$ iterations. \n\nGiven that we're interested in values of $x$ such that $f^{[2005]}(x) = 1/2$, we are essentially looking for the midpoints of the end segments (since each segment is an interval going from $0$ to $1/2$ or $1/2$ to $1$, with $1/2$ being the midpoint). One key point here is this: each segment has exactly one such midpoint. \n\nTherefore, at the 2005-th level of the binary tree, there are $2^{2005}$ segments hence $2^{2005}$ midpoints, which give us the number of values of $x$ that satisfy $f^{[2005]}(x) = 1/2$. \n\nOur final answer can indeed be written in the form $2^{2005} = p^a$, where $p=2$ and $a=2005$ are both positive integers and $p$ is prime. \n\nThus, the sum $p + a$ requested by the problem is $2+2005=\\boxed{2007}$. \n\nThis seems to be aligned with the reasoning presented from the other agents.

This can be visualized as a binary tree, where each node represents a segment and has two children representing the two subsegments.\n\nThe crucial observation lies in the fact that we are looking for the values of $x$ such that $f^{[2005]}(x) = 1/2$, which corresponds to the midpoint of each segment. Since each segment has exactly one such midpoint, the number of necessary $x$ values will be the same as the number of segments.\n\nSo after 2005 applications of the function, we have $2^{2005}$ segments, and hence $2^{2005}$ midpoints.

This results in the same number of midpoints, since each segment can contribute one midpoint that fulfills $f^{[2005]}(x)=1/2$.\n\nAgent2, however, perceives that no matter how many times we apply the function, there will be only two intervals that \"include\" $1/2$ in the middle. Thus, the number of midpoints (or the number of $x$'s that give $f^{[2005]}(x)=1/2$) is limited to $2$.\n\nTo assess these two interpretations, let's focus on the definition of the function $f(x)$. The function oscillates between the zones $[0,0.5]$ and $(0.5,1]$. If we denote endpoints of an interval with $1$ and midpoints with $0.5$, each application of $f(x)$ will replace an endpoint by two scaled-down versions of the original segment, while the midpoint is replaced by an endpoint and a midpoint (either $[0,0.5]$ or $(0.5,1]$).\n\nThis property creates the doubling effect witnessed when we segmentize and rescale repeatedly. If we see the iterations as a binary tree, each level, which corresponds to an iteration, expands the count of nodes (or \"solutions\") twofold. A level-2005 tree would then carry $2^{2005}$ nodes/solutions.\n\nWe assert, therefore, that Agents 0 and 1 are correct and that $2^{2005}$ is the correct count of solutions, which indeed converts into $2^{2005}=p^a$ with $p=2$ and $a=2005$.

For $\\frac{1}{2} < x \\leq 1$, we have $f(x) = 2 - 2x$, and for inverse we have $x = 1 - \\frac{f(x)}{2}$.\n\nWhat this means is that, when we iterate the function $f$ on any number $x$ in the interval $[0,1]$, the answer will always be in the interval $[0, 1]$ - i.e., the interval is preserved by the function $f$.\n\nRound 2:\nNotice that as we iterate the function, we are effectively \"zooming in\" on the interval $[0,1]$. \n\nLet's take $f^{[2]}(x) = f(f(x))$. If $f(x)$ lands in the interval $[0, 1/2]$, then the next $f(x)$ will land in the interval $[0, 1]$. If $f(x)$ lands in the interval $(1/2, 1]$, then the next $f(x)$ will also land in $[0, 1]$. \n\nLooking at $f^{[3]}(x)$, you see that the interval $[0,1]$ is effectively divided into four parts: $[0, 1/4]$, $(1/4, 1/2]$, $(1/2, 3/4], [3/4, 1]$. So, at the $n$-th iteration, the interval will be divided into $2^n$ parts.\n\nRound 3:\nNow, we want to find out how many values of $x$ for which $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$.

For example, when we divide the interval into 4 parts, the middle two intervals are $(1/4, 1/2]$, $(1/2, 3/4]$. \n\nIn the 2005th iteration, the number of total intervals is $2^{2005}$ and the number of intervals containing $1/2$ is 2, so the total values of $x$ for which $f^{[2005]}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ is $2^{2005}$.\n\nRound 4:\nTo bring it into the form $p^a$, where $p$ is a prime and $a$ is a positive integer, we can express $2^{2005}$ as $2^{5*401} = (2^5)^{401}$.
