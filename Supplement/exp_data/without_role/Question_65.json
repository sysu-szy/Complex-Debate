{"question": "The sum of the product and the sum of two positive integers is $454$. Find the largest possible value of the product of their sum and their product.", "answer": "With word problems, the first step is to translate the words into equations. Let the two numbers be $a$ and $b$. Then their sum is $a+b$ and their product is $ab$. The sum of their product and their sum is $a+b+ab$. So we know  \\begin{align*}\nab+a+b&=454\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na(b+1)+(b+1)&=454+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(a+1)(b+1)&=455.\n\\end{align*}The prime factorization of $455$ is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 13$. Since the equation is symmetric with $a$ and $b$, we may (without loss of generality) suppose that $a<b$. Thus $a+1<b+1$, so in each factor pair the smaller factor is equal to $a+1$.

However, as the process to solve it is direct, we can use an automated tool such as a graphing calculator or mathematical software to find the value of x which makes $Z'$ zero. Evaluating Statement C, we get x approximately equal to 85.5.\n\nRound 5:\nConsidering, the integers constraint, we evaluate the value of $Z$ for $x = 85$ and $x = 86$, then compare which one gives a higher value.
