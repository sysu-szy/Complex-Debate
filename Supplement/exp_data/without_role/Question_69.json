Let's break this down:\n\nStep 1: The largest circle has a diameter of 16 inches, which implies its radius is 8 inches. The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r\u00b2. Hence, substituting 8 for r in this formula, we get $64\u03c0$ square inches for the area of the largest circle.\n\nStep 2: The diameter (and therefore the radius) of subsequent circles decreases continuously by a factor of half. Since area of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius, it stands to reason that each succeeding area will be a quarter of the preceding one. This gives us a geometrical progression, where $a = 64\u03c0$, and $r = 1/4$ (where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio).\n\nStep 3: The formula for the sum S of an infinite geometric series is given by $S = a / (1 - r)$. This is valid only when the value of $|r|$ is less than 1, which is satisfied here. Substituting our $a$ and $r$ values into this formula, we get:\n\n$S = 64\u03c0 / (1 - 1/4) = 64\u03c0 / (3/4) = 64\u03c0 * (4/3) = 256\u03c0 / 3$ square inches.\n\nStep 4: The value $256\u03c0 / 3$ is approximately 269.444.
