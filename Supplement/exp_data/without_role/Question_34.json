A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. This means we need to identify pairs of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) that, when combined, form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe can combine the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 in the following ways: 12, 14, 21, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 41, 42, 43, and 12.

All agents agree that to check whether a number is divisible by 4, we only need to check the last two digits.\n\nRound 2:\n\nLet's start by generating the 2-digit numbers divisible by 4. All pairings of the four digits are: 12, 14, 21, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 41, 42, 43, and 12. Corresponding to the rule of divisibility by 4, the valid combinations are: 12, 14, 24, and 32. So, the total 2-digit numbers divisible by 4 are four.\n\nRound 3:\n\nNow, thinking about four-digit numbers, every permutation of four digits (1,2,3,4) will result in a number that ends in a valid two-digit pairing that we identified in round 2, because of the nature of permutations (each ordering of the set is considered). \n\nKnowing this, we can take a shortcut and instead permutation all four digits.

However, we need to exclude those arrangements resulting in the last two digits being 14 and 34 because 14 and 34 are not divisible by 4. \n\nThe rationale is as follows: for each of the two invalid pairs, the other two digits can be placed in the first two positions in 2 * 1= 2 ways. Consequently, there are 2 (for two invalid pairs) * 2 (arrangements of the other numbers) = 4 invalid four-digit numbers. \n\nTherefore, the number of valid four-digit numbers is 24 - 4 = 20.\n\nStep 3:\n\nFinally, we add the numbers from each category together to get the total number of positive integers divisible by 4.

These pairs can also act as the last two digits of other numbers, while maintaining the divisibility by 4. \n\nStep 3: Form three-digit numbers\nNow, for three-digit numbers, we can simply put the one remaining digit (out of {1, 2, 3, 4} after forming a valid pair) to the hundreds place.

However, we should subtract those configurations where the last two digits form a pair that isn't divisible by 4. These non-valid pairs are {14, 21, 23, 41, 43, 31} which counts as 6 in total. We have 2 places to put these non-valid pairs (either at the end or starting digits) and the remaining two digits can then be arranged in 2! ways.
