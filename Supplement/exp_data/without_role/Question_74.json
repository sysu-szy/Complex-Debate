But also, as the value of $n$ increases, the function $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ has more oscillations within the interval $[0,1]$, resulting in additional changes of sign. \n\nThis alters the overall sign of the product $\\sin(\\pi x) \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\cdot \\sin (3 \\pi x) \\cdots \\sin(8 \\pi x)$ at certain points in $[0,1]$, corresponding to the zero-crossings of the $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ functions. Each zero-crossing, however, does not necessarily correspond to a separate interval in which the argument of the logarithm is positive since they could introduce an odd number of negative factors, making the overall product negative.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of disjoint intervals on $(0,1)$ where the product is positive, we need to consider the range of $x$ that allows an even number of the $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ functions to oscillate faster than the others, reaching the third or the fourth quadrant to produce negative values.\n\nBy careful analysis, the resulting intervals that satisfy these conditions are: $(0,1/8)$, $(1/7,1/6)$, $(1/5,1/4)$, $(1/3,1/2)$, $(2/3,3/4)$, $(4/5,5/6)$, $(6/7,1)$. \n\nEach of these intervals takes into account the different speeds of oscillations of the $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ functions and the requirement for either all, or an even number of their values to be negative in order for the logarithm to be defined. \n\nTherefore, considering the refined analysis and the comments from other agents, the intersection of the domain of $f(x)$ with the interval $[0,1]$ is a union of 7 disjoint open intervals.

While my original solution focused on the overall number of sign changes, I might have missed considering the unique instances when the product of the sine functions is positive. Looking at other solutions, I can observe that they mostly employed a similar approach but with differing results, which suggests possible errors in reasoning or calculations. Let's correct that.\n\nFrom my solution, we know that every individual $\\sin(k\\pi x)$ term changes its sign, going from positive to negative, at $x = \\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{3}{k}, \\ldots \\frac{2k-1}{k}$. This happens $k$ times for values of $k$ within $1$ to $8$. Therefore, the overall product changes sign at each of these points. \n\nHowever, the crucial observation we need to consider is that the value of the function can only be positive or undefined (as logarithm is undefined for non-positive values). When undefined, it means that one of the $\\sin(k\\pi x)$ values has to be zero and when positive, it means we have an even number of sign changes (since even number of negatives make a positive). This is possible only when none of the individual terms are zero and the rest of the terms have an even number of negatives. \n\nTherefore, instead of all 36 sign changes creating a new interval for the function as I originally thought, the intervals will be formed only between sign changes that are not hitting zero as those intervals alone can have the product being positive. Furthermore, we need to ensure that each of these intervals has an even number of negatives for the function to be positive.\n\nWith these corrections in mind, let's calculate the intervals correctly this time. \n\nFirstly, the intervals with all values positive are: $[(0, 1/8), (1/7, 1/6), (1/5, 1/4), (1/3, 3/8), (1/2, 5/8), (2/3, 3/4), (4/5, 5/6), (6/7, 7/8), (1, 9/8)]$. \n\nNow, within these intervals, we have altogether 5 points where sign changes (not hitting zero).

For $x\\in(0,1)$, $\\sin(\\pi x)$ is positive. Hence that part of the product is not a problem. But each of the other terms, $\\sin(2 \\pi x)$, $\\sin(3 \\pi x)$,..., $\\sin(8 \\pi x)$ can change sign within $(0,1)$. \n\nRound 5: Precisely these functions change sign at $x=n/2$, $x=n/3$, ..., $x=n/8$, for some integer $n$. Moreover the periodicity of these functions implies that the signs of these functions in the intervals $(n/k,(n+1)/k)$ alternate starting with plus.\n\nRound 6: To find out when the total product is negative, we can find out when an odd number of these terms is negative. \n\nRound 7: Using the previous rounds, it follows that these happen at the intervals: $(1/2,2/3)$, $(2/3,3/4)$, $(3/4,4/5)$, $(4/5,5/6)$, $(5/6,7/8)$, $(7/8,8/9)$, $(8/9,1)$.\n\nRound 8: Therefore, since $\\log_{10}(x)$ is only defined for $x>0$, the intersection of the domain of $f$ with $[0,1]$ is the collection of the set of these intervals, for which the total product is positive.\n\nFinal Round: Counting the number of intervals from Round 7, we find our final answer, namely, there are, as disjoint unions, a total of $7$ intervals for the function $f$.\n\nThus,  \n\n\\[\\boxed{n=7}.\\]", "round 1": "Analysing the different approaches from the agents and my initial solution, it's clear that the product is positive when an even number of its components are negative. Specifically, none of the terms can be negative, or an even number of them can be negative. \n\nReiterating the fact that the sin function is positive in the first and second quadrants and negative in the third and fourth quadrants, all of them have a period of $1/k$ in the function $\\sin(k\\pi x)$.\n\nFrom my initial solution, we can see sin functions change for $(k-1)/k < x < k/(k+1)$ where k ranges from 2 to 8. This is because for $x > k/(k+1)$, $(k+1)\\pi x$ will fall into the negative region of the sine function thus changing the overall parity of the number of negative terms.\n\nThis gives us the intervals in our final solution:\n\n$(2/3, 3/4), (3/4, 4/5), (4/5, 5/6), (5/6, 6/7), (7/8, 8/9), (8/9, 1)$.\n\nHowever, be aware that we have not considered the interval $(1/k, (k+1)/k)$ for $k=2$ where $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is negative, and the rest of the terms positive. This gives us another interval $(1/2, 2/3)$. \n\nTherefore, taking into account that the function will be positive on these 7 intervals, we get the final answer as:\n\n\\[\\boxed{n=7}.\\] This is inline with the initial solution as well.", "round 2": "The product $\\sin(\\pi x) \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\cdot \\sin (3 \\pi x) \\cdots \\sin(8 \\pi x)$ is positive if either all the factors are positive or an odd number of them are negative. \n\nFor each $k=1$ to $8$, $\\sin(k\\pi x)$ is positive in the intervals $0 < x < \\frac{1}{k}$ and $\\frac{2}{k} < x < \\frac{3}{k}$. So, to guarantee all the factors are positive, the solution must lie in the interval $(0, \\frac{1}{8})$ and is in the form of $(\\frac{k-1}{k}, \\frac{1}{k})$ for $k$ from $2$ to $8$, i.e., $(1/2,2/3),(2/3, 3/4), (3/4, 4/5), (4/5, 5/6), (5/6, 6/7), (7/8, 8/9), (8/9, 1)$. Therefore, we get $7$ valid intervals.\n\nHence, the number of disjoint intervals is $\\boxed{7}$."}]}
