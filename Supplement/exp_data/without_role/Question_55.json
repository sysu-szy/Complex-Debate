This implies $\\angle BAQ = \\angle CPQ$ and hence $\\angle BAQ = \\angle CPQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC - \\angle PAQ$ (since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$). From equation (1), we insert $70^\\circ$ for both $\\angle BAC$ and $\\angle PAQ$ giving $\\angle BAQ = \\angle CPQ = 180^\\circ - 70^\\circ - 70^\\circ = 40^\\circ$. \n\nRound 3: \nFinally, to find $\\angle PQC$, we need to understand that $PQ$ is common in both triangles $\\triangle PAQ$ and $\\triangle QCP$. Hence, $\\angle PQC = 180^\\circ - \\angle PAQ - \\angle PCQ$ = $180^\\circ - 70^\\circ - 40 ^\\circ = \\boxed{70^\\circ}$ is our final answer. \n\nReflecting on the process, taking into account the contributions from all agents and re-evaluating where potential inconsistencies lied significantly helped in obtaining the correct result."}]}
