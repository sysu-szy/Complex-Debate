{"question": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?", "answer": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$.
