This includes the possibilities of answering all questions correctly, of answering with only 1 false, and of answering with only 2 falses.\n\n- When answering all questions correctly, there is only 1 way to do this.\n\n- When answering with 1 false, there are 10 questions which could be the one answered incorrectly. Therefore, there are $C(10,1)=10$ ways to do this.\n\n- When answering with 2 falses, there are ten questions, and we could have picked any 2 of them to answer incorrectly, making $C(10,2) = 45$ ways to do this.\n\nRound 3: So, there are a total of $1+10+45 = 56$ responses which don't fulfill the condition of having at least 3 falses.\n\nRound 4: We subtract this number from the total number of responses to get the number of responses which do meet the condition.

Calculating this we get 1024 total possible ways to answer the test.\n\nStep 2: We need to remove instances where fewer than 3 questions were answered falsely. These instances include no false answers, one false answer, and two false answers. \n\n- Instances of no false answers occur only once because every question is answered truly. This gives us 1 instance.\n\n- Instances of one false answer can occur 10 times because any one of the 10 questions could be the one answered falsely. This gives us 10 instances.\n\n- Instances of two false answers can occur in $C(10, 2)$ ways because any 2 out of 10 questions could be answered falsely. This gives us 45 instances.\n\nCombine these excluded instances, we have $1 + 10 + 45 = 56$ instances to exclude.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the excluded instances (56) from the total possible ways to answer the test (1024).

Under these conditions, we have the following cases:\n\n- No False answer: There is only 1 such case, where all answers are true.\n- One False answer: In this case, we can select any 1 out of 10 questions to be false. Therefore, there are ${10\\choose1}=10$ such possible ways.\n- Two False answers: Here, we can select any 2 out of 10 questions to be false.

Given 10 questions, each of which can be either true or false, there are a total of $2^{10}$ or 1024 ways to answer.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, since at least 3 of the questions must be answered with a false, we need to subtract from 1024 the combinations where less than 3 or 2, 1, and 0 questions are answered with a false.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. When 2 questions are answered with a false, there are $C(10, 2) = 45$ ways. When 1 question is answered with a false, there are $C(10, 1) = 10$ ways.
