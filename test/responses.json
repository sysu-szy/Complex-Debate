According to #3 and #12, bool(\"The man who smokes BLUEMASTER cigarettes drinks tea.\") = false.", "*answer:\n1. According to #1, the statement \"Li Ying is a player of Jincheng.\" is false.\n2. According to #2, the statement \"Zhao Lin is not a player of Shashi.\" is true.\n3. According to #3, the statement \"The player of Golden City got the first prize.\" is false.\n4. This we do not know for sure, as the information given does not specify which prize the player from Jincheng received, so we cannot confirm if the statement \"The player of Jincheng got the second prize.\" is true or false.\n5. According to #5, the statement \"Zhao Lin did not get the third prize.\" is true.", "*answer:\n1. According to #1, bool(\"Li Ying is a player of Jincheng.\") = false.\n2. According to #2, bool(\"Zhao Lin is not a player of Shashi.\") = true.\n3. According to #3, bool(\"The player of Golden City got the first prize.\") = false.\n4. The information provided does not conclusively confirm whether or not the player of Jincheng got the second prize. Hence we can't definitively answer bool(\"The player of Jincheng got the second prize.\") = ?\n5. According to #5, bool(\"Zhao Lin did not get the third prize.\") = true.", "*answer:\n1. According to #6, bool(\"The man who smokes PALLMALL cigarettes keeps a bird.\") = true. So bool(not \"The man who smokes PALLMALL cigarettes keeps a bird.\") = false.\n2. According to #9, bool(\"The Norwegian lives in the first house.\") = true. So bool(not \"The Norwegian lives in the first house.\") = false.\n3.

So bool(not \"The neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes drinks mineral water.\") = false.", "*answer:\n1. According to #3, bool(\"The Dane drinks tea.\") = true. According to #7, bool(\"The owner of the yellow house smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = true. So bool(\"The Dane drinks tea.\" and \"The owner of the yellow house smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = true.\n2. According to #8, bool(\"The man who lives in the middle house drinks tea.\") = false, because the man in the middle house drinks milk. According to #9, bool(\"The Norwegian lives in the first house.\") = true. So bool(\"The man who lives in the middle house drinks tea.\" and \"The Norwegian lives in the first house.\") = false.\n3. According to #11, bool(\"The horseman does not live beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = false, because the horseman lives beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes. Since there is no specific information about what drink the neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes has, we can't definitely say that he drinks coffee. So, without that specific information, bool(\"The neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes drinks coffee.\") = false. Therefore, bool(\"The horseman does not live beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\" and \"The neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes drinks coffee.\") = false.", "*answer:\n1. According to #3, bool(\"The Dane drinks tea.\") = true. According to #7, bool(\"The owner of the yellow house smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = true. So bool(\"The Dane drinks tea.\" or \"The owner of the yellow house smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = true.\n2.

According to #11, bool(\"The horseman does not live beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\") = false, because the horseman lives beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes. There is no provided information on the drink preference of the neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes, so we cannot verify bool(\"The neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes drinks coffee.\"). Assuming it is false based on available information, bool(\"The horseman does not live beside the man who smokes DUNHILL cigarettes.\" or \"The neighbor of the man who smokes mixed cigarettes drinks coffee.\") = false."]
