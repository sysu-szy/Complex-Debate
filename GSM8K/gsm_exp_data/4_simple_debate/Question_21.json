Since there are 10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row, we can find the total by multiplying rows times flowers per row. So 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers in total.\n\nRound 2:\nNow, we know that only 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. The question requests how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed. We can find this by taking 4/5 of the total number of flowers.\n\nTo take 4/5 of 200 flowers, we multiply 4/5 by 200:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{5} * 200 = \\frac{800}{5}\\]\n\nRound 3:\nSimplify \\[ \\frac{800}{5}\\] by dividing 800 by 5, we get the answer 160.\n\nHence, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

Since she has 10 rows of flowers and there are 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers can be found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row. So, we calculate 10 rows * 20 flowers/row to get 200 flowers.\n\nRound 2:\nThen we find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We're told that 4/5 of the overall number of flowers have bloomed. To find out how many this is, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers, which means multiplying the fraction 4/5 by the total amount of flowers.\nSo we calculate (4/5) * 200, which equates to 800/5.\n\nRound 3:\nFinally, we simplify 800/5 and get the result as 160.
