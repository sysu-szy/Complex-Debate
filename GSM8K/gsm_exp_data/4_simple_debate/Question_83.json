{"question": "A wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?", "answer": "Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.\nThe mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.\n#### 2", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\nThe problem states that half the mural is yellow, and we know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Therefore, the yellow paint used is 12/2 = 6 pints.\n\nRound 2:\nThe remainder of the mural is divided equally among the colors Red, White, and Purple. Since we started with 12 pints of paint and used 6 pints for the yellow, we have 12-6 = 6 pints left for these three colors.\n\nRound 3:\nGiven that the 6 pints are divided evenly among Red, White, and Purple, we see that each of these colors accounts for 6/3 =\\boxed{2} pints of paint.

Therefore, to find out the amount of yellow paint used, we can simply divide the total amount of paint by 2.This gives us 12/2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.\n\nRound 2:\n\nThe problem further states that the other half - or 50% - of the mural is covered in equal parts by three colors namely red, white, and purple. This means that these three colors together make up the remaining half of the paint not taken by the yellow which is also 6 pints since 12 pints total - 6 pints yellow = 6 pints.\n\nRound 3:\n\nLastly we are to find out specifically how much red paint was used. Given that the three colors red, white, and purple share equally the 6 pints of paint, we can get the amount of red paint by dividing these 6 pints by the 3 colors.

However, half the mural is yellow, meaning that exactly half of the total paint used is for the yellow portion. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of yellow paint by dividing 12 pints by 2, which gives us 6 pints of yellow paint. \n\nStep 2:\n\nNow, for the rest of the mural, we already know that the other half (which is also 6 pints) is comprised of three different colors: red, white, and purple. These three colors share the 6 pints equally according to the problem.\n\nStep 3:\n\nWe can now find how many pints each of the three colors use by dividing the 6 pints by 3. As a result, we have 6/3 = 2 pints.
