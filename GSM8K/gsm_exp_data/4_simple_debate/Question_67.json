{"question": "Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. How many shells does Kylie collect on Tuesday?", "answer": "On Monday, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 shells\nOn Tuesday, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 shells\n#### 50", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \nFirst, we need to determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. The problem states that \"On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.\" To determine how many shells Kylie collected, we simply add the number of shells Robert collected (20) to the additional shells Kylie collected (5). Using the rule of addition, if we add 20 + 5 we get 25. This means Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday.\n\nRound 2: \nNext, based on the problem statement, we know that on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This is where we apply the rule of multiplication. To find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday (25) by 2. If we multiply 2 by 25, we get 50. Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.\n\nIn conclusion, Kylie collected \\boxed{50} shells on Tuesday.", "round 1": "Step 1:\nIn the problem, it's stated that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday. Given that Robert collects 20 shells, to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday, we add 5 to Robert's total 20 shells. So, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.\n\nStep 2:\nThen, in the problem, it's mentioned that on Tuesday Kylie collects twice the number of shells than she did on Monday. So we need to double the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday (which is 25) to find out how many shells she collected on Tuesday.

Knowing that Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday, we can find the amount she collects on Tuesday by doubling this number: 25 * 2 = 50 shells.\n\nBy carefully dissecting the information and following the logic, my conclusion is that Kylie collects \\boxed{50} shells on Tuesday."}, {"round 0": "Debater 1: In the problem, it is given that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday. Since Robert collects 20 shells, Kylie would collect 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday. \n\nDebater 2: Yes, that's correct. Then, on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So if she collected 25 shells on Monday, then she would collect 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.\n\nDebater 1: Agreed.
