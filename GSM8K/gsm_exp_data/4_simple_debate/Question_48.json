So we remove this from his original total. This means Howard has $100 - $8 = $92 left. \n\nRound 2: Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday. \n\nReasoning: This means that Howard spends 2 * $8 = $16 on Tuesday. We need to subtract this from his current total. So after Tuesday, Howard has $92 - $16 = $76 left.\n\nRound 3: Howard spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.\n\nReasoning: This means that Howard spends 4 * $16 = $64 on Wednesday. Subtracting this from his current total gives us $76 - $64 = $12. \n\nSo, at the end of all this spending, Howard has \\boxed{12} dollars left.", "round 1": "Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe problem statement provides the amount of money Howard spent on Monday at the arcade, and then it describes how the expenditure changes over the next two days. The amount spent on Tuesday is twice the amount he spent on Monday and the amount spent on Wednesday is four times the amount he spent on Tuesday. Given that Howard initially had $100, we want to find out what amount of money Howard had left after three days of spending.\n\nStep 2: Calculating Howard's spending\n\nOn Monday, Howard spends $8, so we subtract this from his initial amount: $100 - $8 leaves him with $92. \n\nOn Tuesday, Howard spends double the amount he spent on Monday, which means he spends $8 * 2 = $16 on Tuesday. Subtracting this from what he had left after Monday: $92 - $16 leaves him with $76. \n\nOn Wednesday, Howard spends four times the amount he spent on Tuesday. This means he spends $16 * 4 = $64. Subtracting this from what he had left after Tuesday: $76 - $64 leaves him with $12.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\n\nSo, after spending money at the arcade on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, Howard has \\boxed{12} dollars left.", "round 2": "Looking at the solutions provided by other agents, I agree with their approach and steps to solve the problem. Here's my solution:\n\n1. Howard starts with $100. On Monday, he spends $8, leaving him with $100 - $8 = $92.\n\n2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, he spends 2 * $8 = $16. After Tuesday\u2019s spending, he has $92 - $16 = $76.\n\n3. On Wednesday, Howard spends four times the amount he spent on Tuesday, which amounts to 4 * $16 = $64.

So he has $100 - $8 = $92 left.\n\nRound 2: On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Since he spent $8 on Monday, that means he spends 2 * $8 = $16 on Tuesday. After spending $16, he now has $92 - $16 = $76 left. \n\nRound 3: On Wednesday, Howard spends 4 times as much at the arcade as he did on Tuesday. Since he spent $16 on Tuesday, that means he spends 4 * $16 = $64 on Wednesday. After spending $64, he now has $76 - $64 = $12 left.\n\nTherefore, Howard has $12 left after spending money at the arcade on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So, the answer to the math problem is \\boxed{12}.", "round 1": "Based on the explanations provided by the other agents, we can step through the problem and solve it in the following way:\n\n1. On Monday, Howard spends $8. We calculate his remaining money by subtracting his spending from the original amount of money he had. Therefore, $100 - $8 = $92.\n\n2. On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as on Monday. We calculate this amount as 2 * Monday's spending which is 2 * $8 = $16. So after Tuesday's spending, he will have $92 - $16 = $76 left.\n\n3. Finally on Wednesday, Howard spends four times his Tuesday's spending. We get this amount to be 4 * Tuesday's spending, i.e., 4 * $16 = $64. Remaining money after Wednesday will be $76 - $64 = $12.\n\nThus, after this calculation, we see that Howard will have \\boxed{12} dollar left.", "round 2": "Upon reviewing the solutions submitted by the other agents, I concur with their line of reasoning and calculations. Here's my simplified walkthrough of the problem solution:\n\n1. Howard spends $8 on Monday, which from his initial $100 leaves him with $100 - $8 = $92 remaining. \n\n2. On Tuesday, Howard spends double what he spent on Monday. Thus, his Tuesday expenditure is $8 * 2 = $16. After this, he has $92 - $16 = $76 left over. \n\n3. On Wednesday, Howard spends four times what he spent on Tuesday. So, his Wednesday expenditure is $16 * 4 = $64. This leaves him with $76 - $64 = $12. \n\nTherefore, based on the sequential reasoning and calculations, the solution to the problem is that Howard has \\boxed{12} dollars left after spending money at the arcade from Monday to Wednesday."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: Calculate Tuesday's spending\n\nOn Monday, we know from the problem that Howard spend $8. The question says that on Tuesday, he spends twice as much at the arcade as he did on Monday. Therefore, to calculate this figure, we multiply the money he spent on Monday by 2. This is because twice of any amount is that amount multiplied by 2 (in this case, $8 * 2 = $16). \n\nRound 2: Calculate Wednesday's spending\n\nOn Wednesday, the question states that Howard spends 4 times as much at the arcade as he spent on Tuesday. Therefore, to calculate this figure, we multiply the money he spent on Tuesday by 4. This is because four times any amount is that amount multiplied by 4 (in this case, $16 * 4 = $64).\n\nRound 3: Total spending\n\nAfter calculating the spending amount for each day, we sum these amounts to find out the total amount Howard spent during the three days. That would be $8 (Monday's spending) + $16 (Tuesday's spending) + $64 (Wednesday's spending) = $88.\n\nRound 4: Calculate remaining money\n\nTo calculate the remaining amount from his initial savings, we subtract the total spending from the original amount of money Howard had, which is $100. This is because when you spend money, you reduce your savings by the spent amount (in this case, $100 - $88 = $12).\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{12}.

This comes out to 2 * $8 = $16. So, after his Tuesday spending, Howard has $92 - $16 = $76 remaining.\n\nStep 3: Finally, on Wednesday, Howard spends four times what he spent on Tuesday. Calculating this we have 4 * $16 = $64. After Wednesday's spending, Howard is left with $76 - $64 = $12.\n\nEach of the agents used solid reasoning and arrived at the same conclusion.
