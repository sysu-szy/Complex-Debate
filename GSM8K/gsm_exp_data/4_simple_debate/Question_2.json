If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?", "answer": "Twenty students represent 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the students at that level.\nSo, there are 4 x 20 students = <<4*20=80>>80 students at that level.\n#### 80", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Debater 1: If we're told that three quarters of the students have a desktop computer, it means the remaining one quarter of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. \n\nDebater 2: Agreed, we can use this information to set up our equation.
