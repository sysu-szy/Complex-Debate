We know that Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each time, so the total number of bags Tara bought is 8*5=40. Tara bought 40 canvas bags in total.\n\nRound 2: \nAfter that, we should figure out how much Tara spent to buy the bags. We know that each pack costs $4, and Tara bought 8 packs, so Tara spent 4*8= $32.\n\nRound 3: \nThen, we should find out how much Tara earned by selling the bags. We know that she sold each bag for $8 and she sold 40 bags. So, Tara earned 8*40 = $320.\n\nRound 4: \nThe last step is to calculate Tara's profit. The profit is the amount of money earned from selling the bags minus the amount of money spent to buy the bags. So, Tara's profit is 320 - 32 = $288.\n\nSo, the profit Tara made from selling the bags is \\boxed{288} dollars.", "round 1": "Round 1:\nFirst, we find out how many bags Tara bought altogether. Given that she bought 8 packs and each pack contains 5 bags, Tara bought 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags.\n\nRound 2:\nNext, we calculate how much Tara spent buying the bags. Each pack of bags cost her $4 and she bought 8 packs, hence, she spent 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.\n\nRound 3:\nWe then find out how much she earned from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8 and had 40 bags in total, so she earned 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.\n\nRound 4:\nFinally, we calculate the profit Tara made.

This would be the number of packs times the cost of each pack, 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.\n\nNext, let's calculate Tara's sales. She sold 40 bags at $8 each, which totals 40 bags * $8/bag = $320. \n\nFinally, we subtract Tara's expenses from her sales to find her profit.

Let's review the problem's solution step-by-step:\n\nRound 1:\nThe total number of bags Tara bought is extracted from the amount told in the question, where she purchased 8 packs of 5 bags each. Therefore, 8 packs * 5 bags per pack = 40 bags were bought.\n\nRound 2:\nThen, let's compute the overall cost used to buy these bags. Given the fact that each pack cost $4 and Tara bought 8 packs, total spent is 8 packs * $4/pack = $32.\n\nRound 3:\nNext, we calculate the total earnings Tara obtained from selling the bags.
