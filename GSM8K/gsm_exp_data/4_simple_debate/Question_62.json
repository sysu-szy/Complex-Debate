However, to do that, we need to figure out the duration of his initial trip. According to the problem, he sailed from 1 PM to 4 PM. This means he was traveling for 3 hours. \n\nRound 2: \n\nNow, we know Tom's speed, which is 10 mph, and his travel duration, which is 3 hours. We multiply the speed by the time to find the distance of the trip. \n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles\n\nRound 3:\n\nNow let's answer the main question: How long does it take him to get back? We know from the problem that he's now traveling at a speed of 6 mph. We use the speed and distance to calculate the time it will take him to travel back.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph \n\nThis calculation will give us the time it takes for him to return.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFor the final answer, we found the total distance to be 30 miles. At a speed of 6 mph, it will take him 5 hours to travel back. So, \\boxed{5} hours is the final answer.", "round 1": "Looking at the conclusions from all the agents, it looks like they are all on the same page. Let's re-confirm this.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out the Total Distance traveled by Tom. This was achieved by multiplying the time (3 hours - from 1 PM to 4 PM) that he was traveling by his speed (10 mph). That is, \n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles\n\nNow that we know Tom traveled a distance of 30 miles, we can find how long it will take him to return at a different speed. On his return journey, he is moving at a speed of 6 mph. The formula to calculate his return time is \n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nSo, the return journey is going to take Tom 5 hours.\n\nSo, all agents agree with each other and the final answer would be \\boxed{5} hours.", "round 2": "Firstly, we determine how long Tom was traveling. He started at 1 PM and ended at 4 PM, which gives us a total of 3 hours.\n\nSecondly, we calculate how far he traveled. Given his speed was 10 mph and the time being 3 hours, we use the formula for distance which is Speed * Time. Hence the distance comes out to be 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles. So, Tom sailed a distance of 30 miles.\n\nLastly, we have to determine how long it will take for Tom to return, with a decreased speed of 6 mph. We can find this time using the formula for time in terms of speed and distance, i.e., Time = Distance/Speed. Substituting the values, we get Time = 30 miles/6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nSo, in agreement with the reasoning from other agents, the final answer is that it will take Tom \\boxed{5} hours to return back."}, {"round 0": "Round 1:\nFirstly, let's find out how far Tom's boat has traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

Given his speed of 10 mph and time being 3 hours, the calculation yields Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles. So, Tom sailed a total of 30 miles.\n\nStep 3: Now that we know the distance of his journey, to find out the time it takes for him to travel back at a different speed (6mph), we use the formula Time = Distance / Speed.
