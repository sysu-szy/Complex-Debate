So, 325 kilometers/day multiplied by 4 days gives us 1300 kilometers.\n\nStep 2:\nNow that we know the distance she has already driven, we can determine how much further she still needs to travel to reach New York City from San Diego. As the total distance from San Diego to New York City is about 1955 kilometers, and we've established that Bernice has already covered 1300 kilometers, we can find out how much she still has to drive by subtracting the distance that she's driven from the total distance. Doing the math, 1955 kilometers (total distance) minus 1300 kilometers (already driven) equals 655 kilometers.\n\nWith that, we conclude that Bernice still needs to drive about \\boxed{655} kilometers to reach New York City from San Diego."}, {"round 0": "Round 1:\nFor the duration of 4 days, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day.
