Therefore, we need: \n180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups of dog food. \n\nFor the rest of the first year, which is 365 days - 180 days = 185 days, the puppy needs to eat 2 cups per day. Therefore, we need: \n185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups of dog food. \n\nBy adding the two amounts together, we get the total amount of cups needed: \n180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of dog food. \n\nRound 2: \nNext, we need to determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia needs to buy. One bag contains 110 cups. Therefore, she will need: \n\nTotal cups / Cups per bag = Number of bags. \n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get: \n\n550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags. \n\nTherefore, in the puppy's first year, Cecilia will need to buy 5 bags of dog food. \n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{5}.", "round 1": "First, consider how the food consumption is divided for the puppy in its first year.

So, for these days, it needs 2 cups/day x 185 days = 370 cups. \n\nNow, to find the total amount of food consumed in the first year, simply add both amounts: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups. \n\nFinally, calculate how many bags of food are required to meet this consumption. Considering each bag contains 110 cups, the total number of bags needed is 550 cups \u00f7 110 cups/bag = 5 bags. \n\nSo, Cecilia will need 5 bags of puppy food for the first year.
