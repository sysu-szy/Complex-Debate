The remaining plays for this DVD would be calculated by subtracting 356 from 1000. \nSo it looks like, for DVD one, we have: 1000 - 356 = 644 plays left.\n\nRound 2: \nFor the second DVD, it can also be played 1000 times and it has been played 135 times. The remaining plays for this DVD would be calculated by subtracting 135 from 1000. \nSo for DVD two, we have: 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.\n\nRound 3: \nTo find the total plays left for both the DVDs, we need to add the remaining plays of DVD one and DVD two. \nWhich gives: 644 (from DVD one) + 865 (from DVD two) = 1509 plays. \n\nTherefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \\boxed{1509}.", "round 1": "Analyzing the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: \nThe problem states that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks.

The first DVD has been used 356 times and the second one 135 times. \n\nStep 3:\nTo calculate the remaining play times for each DVD, we need to subtract the usage from the total play limit. \n\nFor the first DVD: (Total limit) - (usage) -> 1000 - 356 = 644 plays remaining. \n\nFor the second DVD: (Total limit) - (usage) -> 1000 - 135 = 865 plays remaining.\n\nStep 4:\nThe problem asks for the total number of plays remaining for both DVDs. So, adding the remaining plays of both DVDs will give the answer. \n\nTotal remaining plays = (DVD1 remaining plays) + (DVD2 remaining plays) -> 644 + 865 = 1509 times.\n\nSo, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \\boxed{1509}.", "round 2": "Sure, let's go through the problem line by line:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the problem.
