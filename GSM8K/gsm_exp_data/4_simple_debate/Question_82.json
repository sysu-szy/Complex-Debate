{"question": "Isabelle bought party supplies for her little sister\u2019s birthday party.

In order to calculate how much each person ends up paying, it necessary to add up the cost of all the items to find the total cost. \n\n$12 (for the cake) + $43 (for gifts) + $15 (for decorations) + $4 (for invitations) + $22 (for goodie bags) equals $96. Now that we know the total amount spent, we can calculate how much each person needs to pay.\n\nRound 2: \nIsabelle split the total cost between herself and her two parents. This means the total cost has to be divided equally among three people.  \n\nSo, $96 (total cost) divided by 3 (people including Isabelle and her two parents) equals $32.\n\nRound 3:\nThe final answer of the problem is each person paid $32 for the party supplies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{32}.", "round 1": "Sure, let's solve the problem by first identifying the total cost spent on the party.\n\nRound 1:\nIsabelle spent money on various items. She spent $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. We need to calculate the total cost she spent on all items, which is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 equals $96. This gives us the total cost spent.\n\nRound 2:\nThe cost was evenly split between Isabelle and her two parents, making a total of three people. We therefore have to divide the total cost by 3. The calculation for this is $96 (total cost) divided by 3 (number of people) which equals to $32.\n\nThis means that each person, Isabelle and her two parents, paid $32 for the party supplies.\n\nTherefore, the revised answer to the problem is \\boxed{32}.", "round 2": "Step 1:\nFirstly, we need to figure out the total amount Isabelle spent on the birthday party. By adding the amounts spent on different items i.e., $12 (cake ingredients), $43 (presents), $15 (decorations), $4 (invitations) and $22 (goodie bags), we can calculate the total cost as so: \n$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96. \n\nStep 2:\nGiven that the total cost was distributed evenly among Isabelle and her two parents (making a total of 3 individuals), we need to divide the total cost by the number of people to ascertain how much each person would contribute. So the calculation goes: \n$96 \u00f7 3 = $32.\n\nConclusion:\nEach person thus had to pay $32 for the party supplies.
