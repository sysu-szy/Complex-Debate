{"question": "Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?", "answer": "June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day\nInitially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day\nTo complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day\n#### 60", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: Calculation of total miles per day to be covered\nSoledad plans on walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she walks 2*125 = 250 miles each day.\n\nRound 2: Calculation of total miles to be covered by the end of the month\nThe month of June has 30 days. Therefore, with her current walking routine, Soledad would cover 30*250 = 7500 miles for the entire month.\n\nRound 3: Calculation of extra miles to be covered\nSoledad's target is to hike 9300 miles in June. Therefore, she needs to cover an extra 9300 - 7500 = 1800 miles to reach her target.\n\nRound 4: Calculation of extra miles to be covered per day\nFinally, to know how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we divide 1800 by the total days in June, which is 1800 /30 = 60 miles more per day.\n\nIn conclusion, Soledad must hike an extra 60 miles per day in order to reach her target of 9300 miles for the month of June. \n\nThis means that \\boxed{60} is the answer.", "round 1": "From all the agents' solutions, it's evident that Soledad needs to cover an extra 60 miles per day to reach her target of 9300 miles for the month of June.\n\nStep 1: Calculation of total miles per day to be covered with her current plan\nShe initially plans on walking 125 miles twice a day, making a total of 2*125 = 250 miles each day.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of total miles to be covered by the end of June \nSince June has 30 days, Soledad would cover 250 * 30 = 7500 miles in total if she sticks to her current plan. \n\nStep 3: Calculation of additional miles needed to meet her target\nSoledad's target is 9300 miles, so she needs to cover an extra 9300 - 7500 = 1800 miles to reach her target.\n\nStep 4: Calculation of additional miles to be covered each day\nDividing the extra miles by the number of days in June gives the extra miles she needs to hike each day.
