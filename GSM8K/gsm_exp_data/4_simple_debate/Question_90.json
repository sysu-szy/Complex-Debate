The given is that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, and twice as many on Tuesday. Additionally, knowing that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, I can calculate the total amount of cookies Sue ate. Furthermore, given that each cookie has 200 calories, we can quantify the total calories consumed by both Sue and her sister on both days.\n\nFirstly, I would calculate how many cookies Sue ate in total. By multiplying the amount her sister ate by 4, we find on Monday, Sue ate 4*5 = 20 cookies. Similarly, on Tuesday, Sue ate 2*13 = 26 cookies. Adding these totals together gives us 20 + 26 = 46 total cookies eaten by Sue. \n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate: 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, equating to 5+13 = 18 cookies in total.\n\nNow, let's convert these totals into calories.

Thus, by multiplying her sister's consumption of 5 cookies by 4, we see that Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday.\n\nRound 2: Similarly, on Tuesday, Sue consumed two times as many cookies as her sister.
