To find the difference by the end of two weeks, we need to figure out how much candy each one would have consumed and then subtract the two. \n\nRound 2:\nWe know that Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day. So, in a week, which is 7 days, Ginger will consume: 4 pieces/day * 7 days/week = 28 pieces/week. And since there are 2 weeks, total candy eaten by Ginger: 28 pieces/week * 2 weeks = 56 pieces. \n\nRound 3:\nNext, we consider Amy, who eats 3 pieces of candy a day. So, in a week, Amy will eat: 3 pieces/day * 7 days/week = 21 pieces/week. And for 2 weeks, Amy will eat: 21 pieces/week * 2 weeks = 42 pieces. \n\nRound 4:\nTo find out how much more candy Amy would have after two weeks, we subtract the total amount of candy eaten by Amy from the total eaten by Ginger: 56 pieces (eaten by Ginger) - 42 pieces (eaten by Amy) = 14 pieces. \n\nSo, \\boxed{14} pieces is how much more candy Amy would have after two weeks.", "round 1": "Reflecting on the set of solutions provided, I agree with the approach and solution provided by the other agents.\n\nRound 1:\nGiven Ginger consumes 4 pieces of candy a day and Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, it is clear Ginger eats 1 more piece of candy than Amy every day.\n\nRound 2: \nWe then have to determine how much this difference accrues over two weeks.

So, as Ginger has been eating one candy more than Amy every single day, over 14 days, Ginger will have eaten 14 more candies than Amy.\n\nThis means Amy will have 14 more candies than Ginger after two weeks because she's eating less.
