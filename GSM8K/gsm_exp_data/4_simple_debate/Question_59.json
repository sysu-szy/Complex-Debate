The youngest son's age is half of this, which would be 8/2 = 4 years old. As per the question, they wash as many oranges as their ages, so the oldest washed 8 oranges, and the youngest washed 4 oranges.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total number of washed oranges\n\nWe add the number of oranges washed by the oldest son and the youngest son together. Therefore, the total number of washed oranges is 8 (oldest) + 4 (youngest) = 12 oranges.\n\nStep 4: Find the number of unwashed oranges\n\nWe know the original number of oranges was 15. To find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the total number of washed oranges from the original amount. This means we subtract the 12 from 15, resulting in 15 - 12 = 3. \n\nConclusion: There are \\boxed{3} oranges left unwashed.", "round 2": "Sure, the question asks for the number of unwashed oranges after all washing has been done by the two sons. \n\nStep 1: Understanding the setup.\nWill bought 15 oranges.

Therefore, he washes 8 oranges. So we subtract 8 from the initially bought 15 oranges, which gives 15 - 8 = 7 oranges left.\n\nStep 3: Number of Oranges washed by the Youngest Son.\nThe youngest son is half the age of the oldest, which means he is 8/2 = 4 years old. Based on this age, he washes 4 oranges. When we subtract these from the remaining oranges, we have 7 - 4 = 3 oranges.\n\nEach of the solutions provided correctly assessed the problem and consistently calculated the appropriate number of oranges washed by each son then subtracted from the original total. \n\nAs such, using basic arithmetic operations on the given statement, it is clear that after both sons wash oranges according to their ages, there will be \\boxed{3} oranges left unwashed in the end."}]}
