How many dollars do they pay in total?", "answer": "Adult tickets cost 12*2=$<<12*2=24>>24\nPopcorns cost 2*3=$<<2*3=6>>6\nThey pay 24+8+6=$<<24+8+6=38>>38 in total.\n#### 38", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \nTo calculate the total cost that the family pays at the movie theater, we first need to evaluate the cost for the individual components - the adult tickets, the child's ticket, and the popcorn.\n\nWe know that each adult ticket costs $12. Since there are two adults in the family (the parents), the total cost for the adult tickets is $12 * 2 = $24.  \n\nRound 2: \nNow, let's calculate the cost for the child's ticket. There's only 1 child in this family, and a child's ticket costs $8. So, the total cost for the child\u2019s ticket is $8 * 1 = $8.   \n\nRound 3: \nMoving on to the cost of popcorn, we know that each popcorn is priced at $3. The family buys 2 popcorns, so the total cost for popcorn is $3 * 2 = $6. \n\nRound 4:\nNow that we have individually evaluated the cost for the adult tickets, child's ticket, and popcorn, we need to add these amounts together to find out how much the family pays in total.\n\nSo, the total cost will be the cost for the adult tickets + cost for the child's ticket + cost for the popcorn = $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.\n\nTherefore, the family pays \\boxed{38} dollars in total.", "round 1": "Sure, let's break it down:\n\nRound 1: Calculation of cinema ticket cost\nThe family going to the cinema consists of 2 adults (parents) and 1 child. The price of an adult ticket is $12. So, for two adults it's 2*12 = $24. The price of a child ticket is $8. Considering there is only one child, the cost remains $8. Therefore, the total ticket cost is $24 (adults' tickets) + $8 (child's ticket) = $32.\n\nRound 2: Calculation of popcorn cost\nThe family buys 2 popcorns and each costs $3. So, the popcorn cost becomes 2*3 = $6\n\nRound 3: Total payment\nFinally, to obtain how much the family paid we add the total ticket cost to the popcorn cost. That is $32 (for tickets) + $6 (for popcorn) = $38.\n\nSo, the family paid a total of \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 2": "Sure, I agree with the given solutions and will provide my approach below:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost for movie tickets\nThe family consists of 2 adults and 1 child. The cost for an adult ticket is $12 and for two would be 2* $12 = $24. The cost for a child ticket is $8. Therefore, the total cost for the movie tickets is $24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) = $32.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost for popcorn\nThe family buys 2 popcorns each costing $3. This brings the total cost for popcorn to 2 * $3 = $6.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost\nAdding up the costs for the movie tickets and the popcorn gives us the total cost. Therefore, $32 (for tickets) + $6 (for popcorn) = $38.\n\nSo, the total spent by the family is \\boxed{38} dollars."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: Calculation of ticket cost\nThe first step is to calculate the total cost of the cinema tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and since two adults are going, we multiply this value by 2 which gives $12 * 2 = $24. Then we add the cost of the child ticket which is $8. So, the total cost of the cinema tickets is $24 + $8 = $32.\n\nRound 2: Calculation of popcorn cost\nNext, we calculate the cost of the popcorns. Since each popcorn costs $3 and they bought 2 popcorns, we multiply $3 by 2 which gives $3 * 2 = $6.\n\nRound 3: Total cost\nFinally, we add the total cost of the cinema tickets and the popcorn to find out how much the family paid in total.

Since the cost of an adult ticket is $12 and there are two adults, the total cost for the adult tickets is: 2 * $12 = $24. Additionally, only one child is present and a child's ticket costs $8, hence the cost for the child's ticket is: 1 * $8 = $8. So, the combined cost of all the tickets is: $24 (for adults) + $8 (for child) = $32.\n\nRound 2: Evaluate the Cost of Popcorn\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn. Each popcorn costs $3 and the family buys 2. Thus, the total cost of popcorn is: 2 * $3 = $6.\n\nRound 3: Evaluate the Total Cost\nFinally, we can now calculate the total cost the family has to pay for the cinema visit. We add the costs for movie tickets and popcorn together to derive this value. Therefore, the total cost is: $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorn) = $38.\n\nAs a result, the family pays a total of \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 2": "To answer this question accurately, we need to break it down systematically. \n\nStage 1: Calculating the Ticket Cost\nThe family consists of two adults and a child.
