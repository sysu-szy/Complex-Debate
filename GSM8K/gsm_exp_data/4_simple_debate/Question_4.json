Every year, he plants an additional 10 trees and chops down 2. This continues over 10 years. Therefore, at the end of 10 years, he will have added (10-2)*10 = 80 trees to his initial number.\nSo, he has 50 (initial amount) + 80 (over 10 years) = 130 trees. \n\nRound 2: Accounting for Tree Death \nUnfortunately, 30% of his trees die after 10 years. To compute how many trees die, we should take 30% of 130. This is calculated as 0.30*130 = 39 trees.\nSo, after ten years and accounting for tree death, he is left with 130 (from Round 1 calculation) - 39 (trees that have died) = 91 trees. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{91}.", "round 1": "First, we must consider how many trees Tom has after 10 years of planting and chopping but before the trees die.\n\nTom starts with 50 trees.\nEvery year, he plants 10 trees and chops 2 trees. The net increase in trees per year is therefore 10 (planted) - 2 (chopped) = 8 trees.\nOver 10 years, the net increase in trees is 8 (per year) * 10 (years) = 80 trees.\nHence, before any trees die, Tom has 50 (original) + 80 (net increase) = 130 trees.\n\nSecondly, we must consider the number of trees that die:\n\n30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is 30/100 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\nSubtracting the number of trees that died from the total before the dying, Tom has \n130 (total before dying) - 39 (died) = \\boxed{91} trees left.\n\nSo my final answer is \\boxed{91}.", "round 2": "I agree with the conclusions of the previous agents. They all have properly analyzed the problem and came up with the correct method to solve it. Let's go through it again.\n\nStep 1: We are given that Tom starts with 50 trees and each year he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2. So, in a year, there is a net increase of 8 trees (10 planted - 2 chopped). Over 10 years, this increase sums up to 80 trees (8 per year * 10 years).\n\nStep 2: Adding this net increase in trees to the initial number of trees Tom had, we get a total number of trees as 130 (50 initial + 80 increase).\n\nStep 3: Unfortunately, after 10 years, 30% of these trees die. To calculate how many trees die, we take 30% of the total, which equals to 39 trees (130 * 0.30).\n\nStep 4: To find out how many trees are left, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before they died. This gives us a result of 91 trees remaining (130 total - 39 died).\n\nIn conclusion, using the same logic and computations provided by the previous agents, it is confirmed that the answer to the problem is \\boxed{91}."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: Initial Calculation\nTom starts with 50 trees and every year, he plants 10 more trees and chops down 2 trees. After 10 years, he would have added 10*10 trees (100 trees) and removed 2*10 trees (20 trees), resulting in a net increase of 80 trees. So, he should have 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.\n\nRound 2: Adjustment for Deaths\nIf 30% of the trees die, we multiply 130 by 30% (or 0.3) to find how many trees have died. That's 130*0.3 = 39 trees. Subtract those dead trees from the total number of trees and we get 130 - 39 = 91 trees.\n\nRound 3: Checking the Answer\nTom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 new trees and chops down 2 trees. So, every year, the number of trees increases by 8 (10 planted - 2 chopped). After 10 years, that's an additional 80 trees.

Let's follow the same steps while confirming each one.\n\nStep 1: The total number of trees after 10 years \n\nInitially, Tom had 50 trees. Over a period of 10 years, he plants 10 trees each year and cuts down 2 trees each year. We calculate the net increase in trees annually which is 10 trees (planted) - 2 trees (cut) = 8 trees.
