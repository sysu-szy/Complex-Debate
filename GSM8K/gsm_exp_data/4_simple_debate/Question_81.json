We can calculate the change she should receive back by subtracting the total cost of the items she bought from the amount she paid with.\n\nRound 4:\nLet's calculate:\n\n$20 - $15 = $5\n\nSo, the mother should receive $5 back in change.\n\nOur answer is \\( \\boxed{5} \\).", "round 1": "Sure, given the solutions from the agents, here's a revised answer.\n\nStep 1:\nTo evaluate how much change the mother receives, we firstly add up the cost of each item bought. This step can be labelled as finding the total cost. The expenses are: \n\n- Cocoa: $4.20 \n- Laundry detergent: $9.45 \n- Package of pasta: $1.35 \n\nAdding these costs together gives us $15. \n\nStep 2:\nNext, we'll figure out the amount of change given by the cashier. The total cost is subtracted from the amount given to the cashier. It's simply $20 - $15.\n\nStep 3: \nSubtracting these values gives us change of $5.

Combining these costs by adding them together, we get $15.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change.\nThe mother paid with $20 for her purchase. So, to find out how much change she will receive, we need to subtract the total cost of the goods from the amount she gave. This computation is given by $20 - $15.\n\nStep 3: Perform the calculation.\nSubtracting $15 from $20 gives us $5.

That would be $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35. This totals to $15. \n\nExplanation: The total cost is found by adding the cost of all individual items.\n\nRound 2: Next, to determine how much change the mother receives, we should take the money she gave (which is $20) and subtract the total cost (which is $15). Thus, the change that the cashier must give back is $20 - $15, which totals to $5. \n\nExplanation: The change given back is the difference between the money paid and the total cost, hence subtraction is used.\n\nHence the final answer is \\boxed{5} dollars.", "round 1": "Sure, let\u2019s break down this problem.\n\nRound 1: \nThe mother bought several items: cocoa for $4.20, laundry detergent for $9.45, and a package of pasta for $1.35.\n\nRound 2:\nTo figure out how much she spent in total, we simply need to add up these costs.

To find out how much the cashier needs to give her back, we subtract what she spent from what she paid with.\n\nFinal Round:\nTherefore, $20 (what she gave) - $15 (the cost of items) = $5 (her change).\n\nSo, the mother gets \\boxed{5} dollars back in change.", "round 2": "Certainly, based on the agent solutions, here is a comprehensive step-by-step updated answer.\n\nStep 1: Add up the costs of the individual items. \n\nCombining the expenses, we have: \n- Cocoa: $4.20\n- Laundry detergent: $9.45\n- Package of pasta: $1.35\n\nUpon adding these three values, we get $15. This is the total amount spent by the mother.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change.\n\nIn order to calculate the change, we subtract the total amount spent by the mother from the amount of money she handed over to the cashier. That is, \n\n$20 (the amount given by the mother) subtract $15 (the amount she spent), which gives $5. \n\nHence, the cashier should give $5 back to the mother.\n\nFollowing the prescribed format, the final answer is \\boxed{5}.

The real question asked here is how much money did the cashier give back in change, not how much did the mother spend in total. \n\nRound 3:  This round is straightforward, we know the amount the mother paid, which is a $20. We need to subtract from this amount the total cost of the items the mother bought. \n\nFinal round: The total change the mother received is $20 - $15 = $5.
