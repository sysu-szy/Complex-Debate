We know that 4x represents the amount that Jeff gets and x refers to the amount Brad gets. So, the total amount can be expressed as 4x + x = 100 dollars. \n\nRound 4: \n\nCombining like terms results in 5x = 100 dollars. Consequently, if we want to know the value of one part or 'x', we need to solve for 'x'. This involves dividing both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nRound 5:\n\nWhen we do this, x is then equal to 100 dollars divided by 5 which equals 20 dollars. This means Brad gets 20 dollars.\n\nRound 6:\n\nHowever, we're asked for the amount that Jeff gets. Remembering from round 2, we know that Jeff gets four times as much as Brad.

Understanding that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we denote Jeff's money as 4B. \n\nRound 2: \n\nThe total sum of money that they are dividing is $100. Therefore, we can put this into an equation which is B (Brad's share) + 4B (Jeff's share) = 100. Simplifying like terms results in 5B = 100.\n\nRound 3:\n\nTo find how much money Brad gets, we need to solve for B. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us B = 100/5 = 20.
