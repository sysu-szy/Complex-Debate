An average is found by adding together all the quantities to be averaged and then dividing by the number of quantities. In this case, we'll be adding the total distance each girl spat their seeds and dividing by 2, because there are two girls.\n\nAverage total distance spat = (Total distance Zoe spat + Total distance Sydney spat) / 2 \n\nAverage total distance spat = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet\n\nSo, the average total distance spat is \\boxed{410} feet.\n\nThe reason for finding the average is to determine the \"typical\" or \"middle\" value in a set of data.

Following the same method as above, we get Sydney's total distance spat as 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Sum of Total Distances\nNext, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney, which gives us 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Average Distance\nLastly, we calculate the average total distance spat, which we can find by dividing the sum of the total distances by the number of participants (which in this case is 2).

To find the total distance spitted by Zoey we just multiply the number of seeds she has by the distance she can spit each one.

Similar to Zoey, we find the total distance spat by Sydney by multiplying the number of seeds she has by the distance she can spit each one. So for Sydney the expression is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed which equals 420 feet. \n\nThe problem asks for the average total distance spat. The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the quantity of the numbers. In this case, we have two total distances, 400 feet (from Zoey) and 420 feet (from Sydney). \n\nAdd these values together to get 820 feet (400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet). Since there are 2 people involved, we divide the total feet by 2: \n\n820 feet \u00f7 2 = 410 feet \n\nSo, on average, the total distance spat is 410 feet. \n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{410}.", "round 1": "Certainly, let's first calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.\n\nFor Zoey, she has 40 seeds and each is spat 10 feet.

That gives us 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.\n\nNow, let's do the same for Sydney. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the average total distance spat. To do this, we'll add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney, and then divide by the number of participants. \n\nSo, the sum of the total distances spat is 400 feet (Zoey's total) + 420 feet (Sydney's total) = 820 feet. \n\nWe then divide this sum by the number of participants, which is 2, hence 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.\n\nThe answer to the problem, or the average total distance spat, is \\boxed{410} feet."}, {"round 0": "First, we should calculate the total distance spat by each participant. \n\nZoey's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat.
