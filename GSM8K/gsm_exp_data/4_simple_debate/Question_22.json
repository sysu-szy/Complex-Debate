In this period, he sold each cup of lemonade at $0.60 and was able to sell 10 cups per hour. Hence, the total earnings from this period can be calculated by multiplying the amount of cups sold each hour (10) by the price per cup ($0.60) and then by the total hours he sold lemonade (2). This gives us: 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we simply add up the earnings from the first 4 hours ($30) and the earnings from the next 2 hours ($12) to obtain the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the course of 6 hours.
