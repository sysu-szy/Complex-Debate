This requires us to consider both the costs of lemons and sugar. Given in the problem, we know that the cost of the lemons for each gallon of lemonade is $3, and the cost for sugar is $2. So, the total cost of making each gallon of lemonade is $3 (for the lemons) + $2 (for the sugar) = $5.\n\nRound 2: Calculating the revenue generated per gallon\n\nNext, we need to find out the sales revenue of each gallon to be able to analyze profit. According to the problem, they're selling each glass of lemonade for $0.50 and they're getting 20 glasses from each gallon of lemonade. Therefore, the revenue from each gallon of lemonade is $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\nRound 3: Determining the profit per gallon.\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit from a single gallon of lemonade by subtracting the total cost from the total sales revenue. The profit is $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5.\n\nRound 4: Figuring out how many gallons were sold\n\nKnowing that the profit from each gallon sold is $5 and that the total profit is $25, we can figure out how many gallons were sold by dividing the total profit by the profit from each gallon. That means they sold $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons in total.\n\nRound 5: Calculating the total lemon cost\n\nFinally, since each gallon requires $3 worth of lemons, the total cost of lemons for the 5 gallons sold is 5 * $3 = $15. \n\nSo the solution to the problem is \\boxed{15}.", "round 1": "Upon review, the solutions offered by other agents are accurate and go through every appropriate step needed to solve the problem.

We know the cost of the lemons is $3 and the cost of the sugar is $2. Hence, the total cost of a gallon would be $3 + $2 = $5.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit they make per gallon. Since a gallon yields 20 glasses of lemonade, and each glass is sold for $0.50, the total income they generate per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\nStep 3: Find the net profit from selling a gallon of lemonade by subtracting the cost of production from the income, which is $10 - $5 = $5.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many gallons were sold. Given that the total profit was $25 and each gallon renders a profit of $5, they sold $25 / $5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.\n\nStep 5: Finally, calculate how much was spent on lemons.

Therefore, the total cost of preparation is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total income from the sale of a gallon of lemonade. The problem provides that they can serve 20 glasses from a gallon and they sell each glass at $0.50.
