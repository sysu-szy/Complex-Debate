So, Chris still has 88 problems to complete after Monday.\n\nRound 2: Determine how many problems Chris has completed after Tuesday\nOn Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he completed 12 problems on Monday, this means he completes 12*3=36 problems on Tuesday. After Tuesday, the number of problems remaining is 88 (remaining after Monday) - 36 (completed on Tuesday) = 52 problems. So, Chris still has 52 problems to complete after Tuesday.\n\nRound 3: Determine how many problems Chris has completed after Wednesday\nOn Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. This means he completes 52/4=13 problems on Wednesday. After Wednesday, the number of problems remaining is 52 (remaining after Tuesday) - 13 (completed on Wednesday) = 39 problems.\n\nConclusion: So, Chris has \\boxed{39} math problems left to complete on Thursday.", "round 1": "Step 1:\nFirst, we have to calculate the number of problems Chris still has left after Monday. Since he started out with 100 problems and completed 12, we have to subtract 12 from 100: 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.\n\nStep 2:\nNext, we determine how many problems Chris completed on Tuesday. We know that he did three times the number of problems he did on Monday, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 problems. Now we deduct this from the problems he had left over on Monday: 88 - 36 = 52 problems remaining.\n\nStep 3:\nOn Wednesday, Chris does a quarter of the problems he still has left. This is computed by dividing the remaining problems by 4: 52 / 4 = 13 problems. With this information, we can now determine how many problems he has left after Wednesday's work by subtracting the number of problems he worked on Wednesday from the ones he had left over on Tuesday: 52 - 13 = 39 problems remaining.\n\nTherefore, after taking into account the work Chris did from Monday through Wednesday, Chris has \\boxed{39} problems left to complete on Thursday. This is the simplest form of the solution since we cannot simplify the number 39 further.", "round 2": "I will follow the steps outlined by the other agents in order to solve this math problem.\n\nStep 1: The number of problems that Chris initially has to complete is 100. If Chris completes 12 problems on Monday, the remaining amount can be calculated by subtracting 12 from 100. So we would have 100 - 12 and that results in 88 problems remaining.\n\nStep 2: On Tuesday, Chris completes three times the number of problems that he did on Monday. Since he completed 12 on Monday, this means he completes 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday. We must then subtract this amount from the total remaining problems. So, 88 - 36 results in 52 problems remaining.\n\nStep 3: On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of his remaining problems. This can be calculated by performing 52 (remaining problems) divided by 4. Consequently, 52 / 4 equals 13 problems. Subsequently, we subtract this from the amount of problems left after Tuesday\u2019s work, so 52 - 13 results in 39 problems.\n\nIn the end, Chris therefore has \\boxed{39} math problems left to complete on Thursday."}, {"round 0": "Round 1:\nTo start solving this problem, we first subtract the number of problems Chris has already solved from the total number of problems. \n\nChris solved 12 problems on Monday, so that reduces the total to 100 - 12 = 88 problems remaining.\n\nRound 2:\nOn Tuesday, Chris solves three times as many problems as he did on Monday. As he solved 12 problems on Monday, this means he solved 12 * 3 = 36 problems on Tuesday.\n\nSubtracting these from the remaining problems, we get 88 - 36 = 52 problems remaining.\n\nRound 3:\nOn Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. A quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.\n\nSo, after Wednesday, the remaining problems would be 52 - 13 = 39 problems.\n\nTo support this calculation, we kept track of the total number of problems and subtracted the problems Chris completed each day. We also used the fact that \"three times as many\" means to multiply and that \"a quarter\" means to divide by four.\n\nSo, by the end of Wednesday, Chris still has \\boxed{39} problems left to complete.", "round 1": "Round 1: After Monday's work, Chris has done 12 problems of his total 100, so we can subtract these to figure out how many are left. That is 100, the total number of math problems, minus the 12 problems he has done, which leaves 100 - 12 = 88 math problems.\n\nRound 2: Tuesday, Chris decides to do three times the work he did on Monday. Given that he did 12 on Monday, that means he completes 12 x 3 = 36 problems on Tuesday. To find out how many he has left, we need to subtract those 36 problems from the remaining 88 problems. So 88 - 36 = 52 problems are left to be done.\n\nRound 3: The following day, Wednesday, Chris takes a fourth of the work he has left and completes it. Working out a quarter of the remaining 52 problems gives us 52/4 = 13 problems.

Subtract these from our previous total to get the new remaining problem count: 88 - 36 = 52.\n\nMoving on to Wednesday's effort, Chris is said to complete a quarter of the remaining problems. We can find out this number by taking a quarter or dividing by 4. So he does 52/4 = 13 problems on Wednesday. To find out how many problems are left for him, we subtract these 13 problems from Wednesday's starting total: 52 - 13 = 39.\n\nSo Chris has \\boxed{39} math problems that he still needs to complete come Thursday."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: \nChris starts with 100 problems.
