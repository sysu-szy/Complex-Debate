On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people\nThe third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people\nFor the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people\nConor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people\n#### 500", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: Let's first calculate the number of people Conor saw on the second and third day.\n\nConor saw 50 people on the first day at the beach. If you add 20 more people to the number of people Conor saw at the beach on the first day, the total number of people Conor saw on the second day becomes 50 people + 20 people = 70 people.\n\nOn the third day, the number of people Conor saw at the beach increased to twice the number that he saw on the second day. That gives a total of 2 * 70 people = 140 people on the third day.\n\nTherefore, in the first three days, Conor saw a total of 50 people + 70 people + 140 people = 260 people.\n\nRound 2: Now, let's consider how many people Conor saw on average for the rest of the week.\n\nWe know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining four days of the week. Therefore, for the four days, the total number of people that Conor saw is 60 people/day * 4 days = 240 people.\n\nRound 3: Let's combine the figures from the first three days and the remaining four days to find out how many people Conor saw in total during that week.\n\nFrom the calculations we performed in round 1 and round 2, Conor encountered a total of 260 people + 240 people = 500 people at the beach that week.\n\nSo, \\boxed{500} is the total number of people Conor encountered at the beach during that week.", "round 1": "Based on the solutions provided by the other agents, let's review and simplify the reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of people seen each day for the first three days.\n\n- Day 1: Conor sees 50 people.\n- Day 2: 20 more people than the first day, so he sees 50 + 20 = 70 people.\n- Day 3: Conor sees double the number of people seen on the second day, so he sees 2 * 70 = 140 people.\n\nSo, for the first three days, Conor sees a total of 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of people seen through the rest of the week.\n\nFor the remaining four days of the week, Conor sees an average of 60 people per day. So, over those four days, he sees a total of 4 * 60 = 240 people.\n\nStep 3: Summarize the total people Conor saw for the week.\n\nAdding the people Conor saw in the first three days (260 people) and the people he saw in the remaining four days (240 people), gives us his total for the week.

If we sum these up, we find that Conor saw a total of 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people during the first three days.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of people Conor saw over the rest of the week. \n\nThe problem tells us that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining four days of the week. Multiplying the daily average by the number of days, we find that Conor saw a total of 60 * 4 = 240 people over the remaining days.\n\nStep 3: Add up the total number of people Conor saw over the entire week. \n\nTo get the total number of people that Conor saw during the week, we add the amount he saw during the first three days (260 people) and the amount he saw over the remaining four days (240 people).

In one week there are 7 days, so if Conor saw an average of 60 people in the remaining 4 days (since we have already accounted for the first three days), it means he saw 4 * 60 = 240 people.\n\nRound 3\nAdding the total amount of people he saw in the first three days (260 people) and the total amount of people he saw in the last four days (240 people) gives us the total amount of people he saw in the whole week.
