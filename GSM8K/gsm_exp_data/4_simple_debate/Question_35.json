The problem also states that Bahati scored the most points which was 20 more than Azibo\u2019s score and 10 more than Dinar\u2019s score. Therefore, if we consider Azibo's score as 'x', then we can express Bahati's score as 'x + 20', and Dinar's score as 'x + 20 - 10' (because Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati). \n\nRound 2:\nThen, if we add up all their scores, we have 'x (Azibo's score) + x + 20 (Bahati's score) + x + 20 - 10 (Dinar's score) = 45 (total score)'. Simplifying, this gives '3x + 30 = 45'. \n\nRound 3:\nWe want to solve this equation for 'x' to find Azibo's score.
