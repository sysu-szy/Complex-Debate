This is our starting point, so we have 4 bananas. \n\nRound 2: \nOn Thursday, John picks an additional 6 bananas. Adding this to the bananas he picked on Wednesday, 4 + 6 equals 10 bananas. \n\nRound 3: \nOn Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 on Wednesday, he would pick 3*4 = 12 bananas on Friday. \n\nAdding the number of bananas he picked every day, we have 10 (from Wednesday and Thursday) + 12 (from Friday) which gives us a total of 22 bananas. \n\nSo, John has \\boxed{22} bananas.", "round 1": "All the agents have aligned solutions, each correctly followed the daily addition as well as the multiplication factor given in the problem. \n\nI agree with them, let's break it down:\n- On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas. \n- On Thursday, he picks another 6 bananas. \n\nSo far, that totals to 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.\n\nOn Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday.

This will give us 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.\n\nRound 3: On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. He picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, so tripling it (i.e 4*3) gives 12 bananas on Friday. The total fruits he now has are the ones he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
