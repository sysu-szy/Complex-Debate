So, 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180 students.\n\nRound 3: We know that there are 5 students for every teacher at Dr.Wertz's school. So, to determine the total number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. Hence, 180 (students) / 5 (students per teacher) equals 36.\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{36} teachers.", "round 1": "Step 1: First, identify the total number of students at Dr. Wertz's school. Since it's stated that there are twice as many boys as girls, and we know there are 60 girls, we can determine the number of boys by doubling the number of girls. Therefore, if there are 60 girls, the calculation for boys is 60 * 2, leading to a total of 120 boys.\n\nStep 2: Now that we've determined the number of boys and girls, we can calculate the total number of students at the school. Simply add the number of boys to the number of girls, so 120 boys + 60 girls equals a total of 180 students.\n\nStep 3: The final step is to find out how many teachers there are at the school by using the information about the ratio of students to teachers. The problem states that there is one teacher for every five students. Thus, to find out the number of teachers, we simply divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. The calculation becomes 180 students / 5 students per teacher, which equals 36 teachers.\n\nTherefore, the updated solution suggests that there are \\boxed{36} teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.", "round 2": "The information in the question already gives us the number of girls at Dr. Wertz's school, which is 60. Since it said that there are twice as many boys as girls, we double the number of girls to find out the number of boys.

Therefore, the total number of students is 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students.\n\nFinally, we find out the number of teachers by using the ratio provided, which is 5 students for every one teacher. So, the number of teachers will be the total number of students (the sum of the boys and girls) divided by the number of students per teacher. \n\nTherefore, the number of teachers = total number of students / number of students per teacher, which equals 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{36}."}, {"round 0": "Round One Explanation:\nFirst, to establish how many students there are in total, we must understand the ratio of boys to girls in the school.
