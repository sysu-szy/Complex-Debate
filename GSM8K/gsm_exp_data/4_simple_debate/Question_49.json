{"question": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?", "answer": "There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.\nAnd, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.\nThus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.\nShe gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.\n#### 30", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1:\nLet's first determine how many cards Miss Maria has in total.

That means 350 total cards - 50 kept cards = 300 cards are given to her students.\n\nRound 5:\nFinally, if each student receives 10 cards, then the number of students Miss Maria has is calculated by dividing the number of cards given out by the number of cards each student receives.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards, which results in 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. The total number of sports cards Miss Maria has is therefore 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.\n\nRound 2: \nHowever, the problem states Miss Maria keeps 50 cards.
