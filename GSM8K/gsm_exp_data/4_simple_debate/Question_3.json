To find this, we need to solve a few smaller steps first.\n\nFirstly, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. The problem tells us that Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time is three times the age of his father when his father saw the comet. According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so if we multiply that by three, we find that Bill's second viewing of the comet was when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.\n\nNow, we know that Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years. So, if Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90, his first sighting must have been 75 years before this. To find this, we can subtract the comet's orbit period from Bill's age at his second sighting. 90 - 75 = 15.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Bill's first sighting of the comet was when he was 15 years old. As required, indicating the answer in the box: \\boxed{15}.", "round 1": "Round 1:\nAs per the information given, Bill's dad saw Halley's Comet when he was 30 years old.

Meaning,  the time difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet will be exactly 75 years. \n\nRound 4:\nTo calculate how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from the age he was when he saw the comet for the second time: 90 - 75 = 15. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Bill was \\boxed{15} years old when he first saw Halley's Comet.", "round 2": "Let's break the problem down:\n\nStep 1: We know from the problem that Bill's dad first saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times that age, so he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.\n\nStep 2: The Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that there is a 75-year gap between Bill's first and second viewings of the comet.\n\nStep 3: To find out when Bill saw the comet for the first time, we subtract the 75 years between sightings from Bill's age at his second sighting.

This means that the time between when Bill saw the comet for the first time and the second time must have been 75 years.\n\nRound 3:\nSolving for the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time, we take the age he was when he saw the comet for the second time (90 years) and subtract the orbit of Comet Halley (75), because he saw the comet the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time.

So, multiplying 30 years by 3, we get that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.\n\nStep 2: The comet Halley orbits once every 75 years, so the interval between the first and second sighting of the comet by Bill is 75 years. \n\nStep 3: As a result, to find the age when Bill saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from how old he was when he saw it the second time.

Therefore, the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet equals 75 years. \n\nStep 4:\nKnowing his age during the second viewing (90 years), we can backtrack to find out how old he was during the first sighting. We do this by deducting the comet's orbiting time from Bill's age during his second sighting. As such, we subtract 75 from 90, giving us 15 years.\n\nSo, through a careful examination of the problem, my agreement with the other agents, and a step by step analysis, I conclude that Bill was \\boxed{15} years old when he saw Halley's Comet for the first time."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: We know that Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 75 years.
