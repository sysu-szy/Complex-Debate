{"question": "Sarah went to buy books from the store and spent $300 on the books. If each book was $15 and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, how many books did each child get?", "answer": "Since she spent $300 on the books and each book's cost was $15, she bought $300/$15= <<300/15=20>>20 books.\nIf Sarah gave an equal number of books to each of her children, each kid received 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 books.\n#### 5", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: \n\nTo solve this problem, first, let's find out how many books Sarah bought in total. Since each book cost $15 and Sarah spent $300 in total, we can figure out the total number of books by dividing the total cost by the cost of each book. \n\nThe formula is: Number of books = Total cost / Cost of each book\n\nTherefore, Number of books = $300 / $15 = 20 books.\n\nExplanation: This is based on the law of division in arithmetic where if a certain total cost is divided equally among same-priced items, the result gives the total quantity of those items.\n\nRound 2:\n\nHaving found out that Sarah bought 20 books, we now have to find out how many books each of her 4 children received. We know that each child received an equal number of books, meaning the total number of books is divided equally among the 4 kids.\n\nThe formula is: Number of books each child gets = Total number of books / Number of kids \n\nTherefore, Number of books each child gets = 20 books / 4 = 5 books.\n\nExplanation: This is based on the principle of equal division. If a certain quantity is distributed equally among a certain number of recipients, each recipient will get a total quantity divided by the number of recipients.\n\nSo, each child got 5 books.

To start with, we were given that Sarah bought books worth $300, and each book cost $15. So, to compute the total number of books she purchased, we divide the total money she spent by the cost of each book. This can be written mathematically as 300 \u00f7 15 which equals 20.
