In decimal form, this rate is 0.79.\n\nWe can express the car's value for each year as a geometric sequence where the initial term (a) is the car's original price of $20000 and the common ratio (r) is the percentage of value the car retains each year, which is 0.79 in decimal form.\n\nWe are required to find the car's value in 2010, which is 3 years after 2007.

In this context, the asset is a car and the car's value decreases by a certain percentage every year. This percentage, called the rate of depreciation, is 21% in this case. \n\nRound 2: \nDepreciation is calculated using this formula: Value = Initial Value x (1 - Rate of Depreciation)^Number of Years. In this case, Initial Value is $20000, Rate of Depreciation is 21% or 0.21, and the Number of Years is 2010 - 2007 = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we will get the depreciated value of the car.\n\nRound 3:\nSubstituting the values into the formula, gives us Value = $20000 x (1 - 0.21)^3.
