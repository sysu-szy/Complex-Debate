This brings the total to 121 + 20 = 141 people on the train.\n\nStep 3: At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train while twice that number board the train. The number of people who board the train is 2 * 50 = 100 people. So, now the total number of people on the train after this stop would be 141 - 50 (those who descended) + 100 (those who boarded) = 191 people.\n\nStep 4: If 80 more people descended at the third station, the total number of people on the train at the final stop would be 191 - 80 = 111 people.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{111}.

This increases the total number of people to 121 (previous total) + 20 = 141.\n\nStep 3: At the second stop, 50 people get off the train and twice that number, i.e., 2*50 = 100 people board the train. So, the new total will be 141 (previous total) - 50 (people who got off) + 100 (people who got on) = 191.\n\nStep 4: At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train. This reduces the total number of people to 191 (previous total) - 80 = 111.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \\boxed{111}. This is derived by simply adding and subtracting the numbers of people who board and alight the train at each stop.

So, first we subtract the number of people that descended: 141 (previous total) - 50 (descended) = 91 people. Then, we add twice the number that descended, which is 2*50 = 100 people.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train after Romeo boards is 120 + 1 (Romeo himself) = 121 people.\n\nRound 2: At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.

Romeo boards the train, so our total increases by 1. So, there are 120 + 1 = 121 people. \n\nJustification: The problem states that Romeo boards a train with 120 people. This implies that Romeo is initially not on the train. So when Romeo boards the train, he adds to the number of people on the train. So we need to count him in our total.\n\nRound 2: At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. We add these 20 people to our previous total. So, 121 (from the first round) + 20 = 141 people.\n\nJustification: The problem states that at the first stop, 20 more people board the train.

We subtract the people who descended and add the people who boarded to our previous total. So, 141 (from the second round) - 50 (descended) + 100 (boarded) = 191 people.\n\nJustification: The problem states that at the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and two times that number boarded the train. The people who descended are leaving the train so they should be subtracted, and the people who boarded are getting on the train so they should be added. \n\nRound 4: At the third station, 80 more people descended. So, we subtract these people from our previous total. So, 191 (from the third round) - 80 = 111 people.\n\nJustification: The problem states that 80 more people descended at the third station.

First we subtract the 50 people who descended from the train. 140 - 50 gives us 90 people who were left on the train. Then we add the people who boarded the train.
