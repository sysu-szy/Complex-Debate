{"question": "Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10.

Given that the cost of the pen is $2, three times its price is 3 multiplied by 2, which equals $6. The piece of paper costs $1 less than $6, which equals $5.\n\nRound 2: Now, we have the cost of each item Theo bought: the pen, which cost $2, and the piece of paper, which costs $5. To find the total amount Theo spent, we add these two costs together. So, 2 plus 5 equals $7.\n\nRound 3: Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change Theo received, we subtract the total amount spent, which is $7, from the amount given to the cashier, which is $10.

Therefore, we have to calculate the cost of the paper.\n\nTo find the cost of the paper:\nFirst, we multiply the cost of the pen (which is $2) by 3, which gives us $6. Secondly, we subtract $1 from this, resulting in $5. So, the cost of the paper is $5.\n\nNow, we have the cost for both items: the pen costs $2 and the paper costs $5. Adding these costs together gives us the total amount Theo has to pay, so $2 + $5 equals $7.\n\nLastly, to find the change Theo received, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she gives to the cashier, which is $10.

Then, we subtract $1 from $6 to get the price of the paper, which comes to be $5.\n3. The total amount Theo spent on both items can be found by adding the cost of the pen and the paper together. Hence, the total spent by Theo is $2 (for the pen) + $5 (for the paper) = $7.\n4. Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she gave to the cashier. Therefore, the change Theo got is $10 (amount given to the cashier) - $7 (total spent) = $3.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Theo received $3 in change, and the final answer is \\boxed{3}.
