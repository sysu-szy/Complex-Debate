We have the distance Tom traveled in Round 1, which is 30 miles. We can use this distance and the rate of 6 mph to find the time it takes to travel back.\n\nLet's represent the time it takes Tom to travel back as \"t\" hours. Using the formula distance = rate * time, we can write the equation 6t = 30. \n\nTo solve for \"t\", we divide both sides of the equation by 6: t = 30/6 = 5.\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back from his original location.\n\nRound 3\nWe have found that it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back from his original location.
