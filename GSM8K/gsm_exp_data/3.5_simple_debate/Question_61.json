We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to simplify this calculation. The formula is:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r),\n\nwhere \"a\" is the initial term (the funding cost for the 6th month), \"r\" is the common ratio (1.5), and \"n\" is the number of terms (50 - 5 = 45, as we exclude the initial 5 months).\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the total research cost:\n\nTotal research cost = $500,000 + a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n                  = $500,000 + ($150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5))\n\nEvaluating this expression using a calculator, we find that the total research cost is approximately $20,760,428.04.\n\nTherefore, the research cost was $20,760,428.04.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20,760,428.04}", "round 2": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Initial Funding: John received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. Therefore, the total initial funding he received is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.\n\n2. Research Duration: The research ended up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.\n\n3. Increased Funding: After the initial 5 months, the funding per month increased by 50%. This means each subsequent month costs 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 times more than the previous month.\n\nNow let's calculate the funding cost for each month starting from the 6th month.\n\nMonth 6: The funding cost for this month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.\nMonth 7: The funding cost for this month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.\nMonth 8: The funding cost for this month is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500.\nMonth 9: The funding cost for this month is $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250.\nMonth 10: The funding cost for this month is $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375.\nAnd so on, with each subsequent month's funding cost being 1.5 times the previous month's funding cost.\n\nTo find the total research cost, we need to sum up the funding costs for all the months. We can observe that the funding cost for each month follows a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1.5. The sum of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r),\n\nwhere \"a\" is the initial term (the funding cost for the 6th month), \"r\" is the common ratio (1.5), and \"n\" is the number of terms (50 - 5 = 45, as we exclude the initial 5 months).\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the total research cost:\n\nTotal research cost = $500,000 + $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5).\n\nEvaluating this expression, we find that the total research cost is approximately $20,760,428.04.\n\nTherefore, the research costed $20,760,428.04.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20,760,428.04}."}]}
