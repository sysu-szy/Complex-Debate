{"question": "Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?", "answer": "Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\n9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels\n#### 12", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nRound 1:\nLet's assume the number of novels Regina has written this year is N.\n\nGiven that she wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the equation:\n9 = (3/4)N\n\nTo isolate N, let's multiply both sides of the equation by (4/3):\n9 * (4/3) = (3/4)N * (4/3)\n12 = N\n\nSo, in round 1, we find that Regina has written 12 novels this year.\n\nRound 2:\nLet's assume that this result is incorrect and Regina has written M novels this year.\n\nUsing the same equation, we can set up:\n9 = (3/4)M\n\nTo isolate M, let's multiply both sides of the equation by (4/3):\n9 * (4/3) = (3/4)M * (4/3)\n12 = M\n\nTherefore, in round 2, we get the same result of M = 12 novels this year.\n\nSince both rounds lead us to the same answer, we can conclude that Regina has written \\boxed{12} novels this year.", "round 1": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the information given.\n\nLet x be the number of novels Regina has written this year.\n\nWe are told that last year, Regina wrote 9 novels, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.
