{"question": "Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day.

This means that there were 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 people at the beach on the second day.\n\nOn the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. So, if there were 70 people on the second day, then on the third day there were 2 * 70 = <<2*70=140>>140 people at the beach.\n\nFrom the fourth day onwards, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 7 days in a week and Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, the total number of people Conor saw on those days is 7 * 60 = <<7*60=420>>420 people.\n\nTo find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to add up the number of people from each day. So, the total is 50 + 70 + 140 + 420 = <<50+70+140+420=680>>680 people.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \\boxed{680}.", "round 1": "To solve this math problem, let's break down the information given step by step.\n\nOn the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach.\n\nOn the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people was 50 + 20 = 70.\n\nOn the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which means there were 2 * 70 = 140 people on the third day.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.
