Since Ginger eats 4 pieces per day, in two weeks (14 days), she eats a total of 4 x 14 = <<4*14=56>>56 pieces of candy.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many pieces of candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces per day, in two weeks (14 days), she eats a total of 3 x 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 pieces of candy.\n\nNow, let's find the difference in the number of candy pieces they have after two weeks. Since both Ginger and Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, the difference is 100 - 56 - 42 = <<100-56-42=2>>2 pieces of candy.\n\nTherefore, after two weeks, Amy has 2 more pieces of candy than Ginger. \n\nOur final answer, in simplified form, is \\boxed{2}.", "round 1": "To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we can calculate the total number of candy pieces they each eat in two weeks and compare the amounts.\n\nIn two weeks, Ginger eats a total of 4 pieces per day * 14 days = 56 pieces of candy.\n\nIn two weeks, Amy eats a total of 3 pieces per day * 14 days = 42 pieces of candy.\n\nTo find the difference in the number of candy pieces they have, we subtract the amount that Ginger eats from the amount that Amy eats: 42 - 56 = -14.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with candies, we cannot have a negative number of candies.

Meanwhile, Ginger eats a total of 4 pieces of candy per day for 14 days, resulting in 56 pieces of candy consumed. \n\nBased on these calculations, it is clear that Ginger has consumed more candy than Amy.
