The problem states that she will be walking twice a day.\n\nNow, let's determine how many miles Soledad walks each time. The problem gives us that she plans to cover 125 miles each time she walks.\n\nTo find out how many miles she walks in a day, we need to multiply the distance she walks each time by the number of walks she takes in a day. Soledad walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This means she walks a total of 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.\n\nFinally, to calculate how many miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the total miles she plans to hike in June from the miles she walks per day. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in total, but she can only cover 250 miles per day. Therefore, she must hike an additional 9,300 - 250 = 9050 miles per day.\n\nThus, Soledad must hike an additional 9050 miles per day to complete her journey on time.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{9050}.", "round 1": "To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to determine the total miles she needs to cover in June and subtract the miles she plans to cover from that.\n\nSoledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in the month of June.
