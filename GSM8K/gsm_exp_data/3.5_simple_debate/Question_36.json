The first DVD can be played 1000 times and it has already been played 356 times. Thus, the number of plays left on the first DVD is:\n\nPlays left on first DVD = 1000 - 356 = 644\n\nNow, let's find the number of plays left on the second DVD. Similarly, the second DVD can be played 1000 times and it has already been played 135 times. Therefore, the number of plays left on the second DVD is:\n\nPlays left on second DVD = 1000 - 135 = 865\n\nTo find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of plays left on each DVD:\n\nTotal plays left = Plays left on first DVD + Plays left on second DVD\n\nTotal plays left = 644 + 865 = 1509\n\nThus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1509}", "round 1": "To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played. \n\nThe first DVD has been played 356 times and the second DVD has been played 135 times. \n\nSo, the total number of times both DVDs have been played is:\n\n356 + 135 = 491\n\nTherefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 491 times before they break.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{491}", "round 2": "To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we can add the number of times each DVD has been played.\n\nThe first DVD has been played 356 times and the second DVD has been played 135 times.\n\nSo, the total number of times both DVDs have been played is:\n\n356 + 135 = 491\n\nTherefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 491 times before they break.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{491}"}, {"round 0": "To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to sum up the number of times each DVD has been played.\n\nFirst, we have one DVD that has been played 356 times and another DVD that has been played 135 times.
