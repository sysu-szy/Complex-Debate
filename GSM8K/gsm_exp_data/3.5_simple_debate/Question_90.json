We are told that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies on Monday.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. We are told that she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So Sue ate 2 * 13 = <<2*13=26>>26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nTo find out how many calories Sue consumed, we need to multiply the number of cookies by the number of calories per cookie. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 20 * 200 + 26 * 200 = 92 * 200 = 18400 calories.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of calories Sue's sister consumed. On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies, so she consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories. On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies, so she consumed 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.\n\nTo find the difference in calories Sue consumed compared to her sister, we subtract the number of calories her sister consumed from the number of calories Sue consumed: 18400 - (1000 + 2600) = 18400 - 3600 = 14800.\n\nTherefore, Sue consumed 14800 more calories than her sister.

Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nTo calculate how many more calories Sue consumed, we need to find the total number of calories she consumed and subtract the number of calories her sister consumed.\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 20 cookies, so she consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories. On Tuesday, she ate 26 cookies, so she consumed 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Therefore, Sue consumed a total of 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories.\n\nHer sister consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 * 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday.
