We are given that for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, the horse will eat 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the hays. Each bale of hay costs $3, so 8 bales of hay will cost 8 x $3 = $24.\n\nMichael has six $5 bills. To figure out how much change he will have after buying the hay, we need to find the total amount he spends on the bales and subtract it from the amount he has.\n\nThe total amount Michael will spend on hay is $24.\n\nTo calculate the change, we subtract the total amount spent on hay from the amount he has. Michael has 6 x $5 = $<<6*5=30>>30.
