We know that on Monday, he completed 12 problems. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completes 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many math problems Chris has left after Tuesday. He started with 100 math problems and completed 12 on Monday and 36 on Tuesday. Therefore, he has 100 - 12 - 36 = 52 problems left after Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many math problems he completes on Wednesday, we need to multiply the remaining problems by one-quarter. Therefore, Chris completes 52 * (1/4) = 13 problems on Wednesday.\n\nFinally, let's find out how many math problems Chris has left after Wednesday. He started with 52 problems and completed 13 on Wednesday. Therefore, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left after Wednesday.\n\nSo, Chris has \\boxed{39} math problems left to complete on Thursday.", "round 1": "To find the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: On Monday, Chris completes 12 math problems.
