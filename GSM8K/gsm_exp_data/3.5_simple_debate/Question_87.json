{"question": "Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?", "answer": "1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min\nIt will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total\nJordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours\nIf the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake\n#### 2", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To find the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the serving time of 5:00 pm.\n\nFirst, we need to account for the 10 minutes it takes to frost the cake. Since this step comes after the cake has cooled for 2 hours, we can subtract 2 hours and 10 minutes from the serving time:\n5:00 pm - 2 hours - 10 minutes = 2:50 pm.\n\nNext, we need to factor in the cooling time of 2 hours. Since this step comes after the cake has finished baking, we can subtract 2 hours from the new start time of 2:50 pm:\n2:50 pm - 2 hours = 12:50 pm.\n\nNow, we need to consider the baking time of 30 minutes. Since this step comes after the cake batter is made, we can subtract 30 minutes from the new start time of 12:50 pm:\n12:50 pm - 30 minutes = 12:20 pm.\n\nFinally, we need to account for the 20 minutes it takes to make the cake batter. We can subtract 20 minutes from the new start time of 12:20 pm:\n12:20 pm - 20 minutes = 12:00 pm.\n\nTherefore, Jordan should start making the cake no later than 12:00 pm in order to serve it at 5:00 pm.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{12:00\\text{ pm}}.", "round 1": "To determine the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm, we need to work backwards from the serving time.\n\nFirst, we need to account for the 10 minutes it takes to frost the cake.

So, if Jordan wants to finish frosting the cake at 5:00 pm, she should start no later than 5:00 pm - 10 minutes = 4:50 pm.\n\nNext, we know that the cake will require 2 hours to cool. Therefore, Jordan should aim to take the cake out of the oven at 4:50 pm + 2 hours = 6:50 pm. This means she should start baking the cake at least 30 minutes before that to allow time for baking. So, Jordan should start baking the cake at 6:20 pm.\n\nBefore baking, she needs to make the cake batter which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake batter at 6:20 pm - 20 minutes = 6:00 pm.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that these times are in the afternoon/evening, so we should make sure they are valid hours on a 12-hour clock.
