Let's say Bahati's score is represented by b, Azibo's score is represented by a, and Dinar's score is represented by d. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that Bahati scored the most points, which means b > a and b > d. Bahati's score was also 20 more than Azibo's, so we can write an equation as b = a + 20. We also know that Bahati's score was 10 more points than Dinar's, so we can write another equation as b = d + 10. \n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution. We can substitute the value of b from the second equation into the first equation. So we have d + 10 = a + 20. \n\nNext, we are given that the total team score is 45 points. So we can write an equation as b + a + d = 45. \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of b from the first equation into the third equation. So we have (a + 20) + a + d = 45. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we have 2a + d + 20 = 45. \n\nWe can also substitute the value of b from the second equation into the third equation. So we have (d + 10) + a + d = 45. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we have 2a + 2d + 10 = 45. \n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and d. \n\nFirst, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the first equation: 2a + d = 25. \n\nNext, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the second equation: 2a + 2d = 35. \n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a. So we have (2a + 2d) - (2a + d) = 35 - 25. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we have d = 10. \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of d into the first equation to solve for a. So we have 2a + 10 = 25. \n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we have 2a = 15. \n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we have a = 7.5. \n\nTherefore, Azibo scored 7.5 points. \n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{7.5}.", "round 1": "From the given information, we can set up the equations as follows:\n\nLet A represent Azibo's score, then Bahati's score would be A + 20, and Dinar's score would be A - 10.\n\nWe are also given that the total team score is 45, so we have the equation:\n\nA + (A + 20) + (A - 10) = 45\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n3A + 10 = 45\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3A = 35\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nA = 35/3\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\nA = 11 2/3\n\nTherefore, Azibo scored \\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}} points.", "round 2": "Let's first explain the given information in the problem.\n\nBahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. \n\nBahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.\n\nBahati's score was also 10 more points than Dinar's score.\n\nBased on this information, let's set up the equations:\n\nLet A represent Azibo's score.
