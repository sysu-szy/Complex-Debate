{"question": "A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both.

How much would she pay in all?", "answer": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art separately, and then deduct the discount from the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the manicure. The basic manicure costs $35, and for each nail art, Karen needs to pay an additional $3 per nail. Since there are five fingers on one hand, the total cost of nail art for one hand is $3 x 5 = $15. Since Karen wants nail art on each hand, the total cost of nail art for both hands is $15 x 2 = $30.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the manicure, including nail art, is $35 + $30 = $65.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the pedicure. The pedicure starts at $40, and there is no nail art required for the feet. Hence, the cost of the pedicure remains at $40.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. Karen wants both a manicure and a pedicure, so the total cost is $65 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $105.\n\nSince the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services, we need to calculate 20% of $105. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.20. Therefore, the discount amount is $105 x 0.20 = $21.\n\nTo find the final cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.
