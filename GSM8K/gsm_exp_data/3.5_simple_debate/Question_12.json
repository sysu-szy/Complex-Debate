He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Therefore, he needs 1 pound of butter for every 6/12 dozen croissants, which simplifies to 1 pound of butter for every 1/2 dozen croissants.\n\nNext, let's determine how many pounds of butter are needed for 6 dozen croissants. Since 6 dozen is equivalent to 6 times 1/2 dozen, we need 6 times 1 = 6 pounds of butter.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter. The grocery store has a promotion where buying one pound of butter gets one half off. Since the original price of butter is $4.00 per pound, half off means we pay (1/2) * $4.00 = $2.00 per pound.\n\nTherefore, the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00.\n\nIn conclusion, it will cost Dennis $12.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter.
