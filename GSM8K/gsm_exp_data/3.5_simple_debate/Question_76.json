{"question": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?", "answer": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 \u2013 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year\u2019s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that Henry baked $x$ cookies last year.\nAccording to the information given, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
