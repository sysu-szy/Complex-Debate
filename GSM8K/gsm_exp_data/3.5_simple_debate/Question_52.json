Since there are 180 days in total, she will need 1 x 180 = 180 cups of dog food for this period.\n\nNow let's consider the remaining days after the first 180 days. Cecilia has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. The remaining days in a year can be calculated as 365 (total days in a year) - 180 (first 180 days) = 185 days. Therefore, she will need 2 x 185 = 370 cups of dog food for this period.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of cups of dog food needed for the entire year. Cecilia needs 180 cups for the first 180 days and 370 cups for the remaining days, giving a total of 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food for the entire year.\n\nSince one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups in each bag to find the number of bags needed.
