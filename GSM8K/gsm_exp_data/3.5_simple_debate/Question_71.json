Charisma meditates for 15 minutes when she wakes up and again before she goes to sleep. So, the total time spent on meditation each day is:\n15 minutes in the morning + 15 minutes in the evening = 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time spent on yoga practice each week. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour per day, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent on yoga practice each week is:\n1 hour per day x 5 days = 5 hours per week.\n\nNow, let's determine the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks. We can simply multiply the time spent per day on meditation by the number of days in 4 weeks (28 days), and add it to the total time spent on yoga practice per week, multiplied by the number of weeks (4 weeks):\n(30 minutes per day x 28 days) + (5 hours per week x 4 weeks)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n30 minutes x 28 days = 840 minutes (14 hours)\n5 hours x 4 weeks = 20 hours\n\nAdd the time spent on meditation and yoga practice together:\n840 minutes + 20 hours\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we need to convert 840 minutes into hours:\n840 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes = 14 hours\n\nAdding the two times together:\n14 hours + 20 hours = 34 hours\n\nAfter simplifying the answer, Charisma has spent a total of 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{34}.", "round 1": "To find the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we can break it down into two parts: meditation and yoga.\n\nFor meditation:\nCharisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, so she spends a total of 30 minutes per day on meditation.\nIn a week, she spends 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes on meditation.\nIn 4 weeks, she spends 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes on meditation.\n\nFor yoga:\nCharisma practices 1 hour of yoga per day, 5 days a week.

So, she spends a total of 15 + 15 = 30 minutes per day on meditation.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time she spends on meditation in a week. Since Charisma meditates for 30 minutes per day, she spends 30 minutes x 7 days = 210 minutes on meditation in a week.\n\nMoving on to yoga practice, we know that Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga each day, 5 days a week.
