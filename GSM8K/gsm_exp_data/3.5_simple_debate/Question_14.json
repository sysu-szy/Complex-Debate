Each invited person says they will invite 2 friends.\n\nSince each invited person invites 2 friends, the number of attendees will be tripled.

Alex calls 10 of her friends to invite them.\n\nAt this stage, there are an additional 10 people invited by Alex. Since these 10 people are her friends, they will bring their spouses as mentioned.
