{"question": "Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?", "answer": "The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33\nThe quilt has 32 square feet from medium shirts because 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32\nThe quilt has 36 square feet from large shirts because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36\nThe quilt is 101 square feet because 33 + 32 + 36 = <<33+32+36=101>>101\n#### 101", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the quilt by adding up the areas of all the different-sized shirts.\n\nFor small shirts, each one has an area of 3 square feet.
