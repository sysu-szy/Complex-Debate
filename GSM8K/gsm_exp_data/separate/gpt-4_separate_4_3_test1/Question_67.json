Here, we need to apply multiplication to solve.\n\n2 (times more) * 25 (shells collected on Monday)= 50 shells.\n\nThis implies that Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday. \n\nSo by examining the question and carrying out the necessary arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication, we determined that the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is \\boxed{50}.", "round 1": "First, we need to determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
