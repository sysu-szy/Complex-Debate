{"question": "At a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?", "answer": "Twenty students represent 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the students at that level.\nSo, there are 4 x 20 students = <<4*20=80>>80 students at that level.\n#### 80", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "This problem is a simple application of the concept of ratios or fractions in Algebra. When they say \"three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home\", it implies that the total number of students is the entire (or 'whole') 100%, out of which 75% (or three-fourths) have a desktop computer. Hence, if 25% (or one-fourth) do not have a desktop computer at home, that is equivalent to 20 students. \n\nWe need to find the total, and to do that we need to calculate how many students would fall into the 100% range. To clarify this, let's denote T as the total number of students which we\u2019re trying to find. Therefore, one-fourth (or 25%) of the total students, or T/4, equals to the number of students who do not own desktop computers \u201420 students. \n\nThe next step is to algebraically solve the equation for T. Since T/4 equals to 20, multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 yields T equals to 80. \n\nSo, the total number of students at that grade level is 80. After solving the equation logically, we can confidently state:\n\n\\boxed{80}", "round 1": "Looking at the problem, it's provided that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.

This indicates that these 20 students are representative of the remaining one-fourth of the student body.\n\nThus, we need to find the total number of students (T) based on this ratio of one-fourth of the students equaling 20.
