Then, according to the problem, 3/4 of this number (x) is 9.

We are asked to find the total number of books she has written this year. \n\nWe denoted the total number of books she wrote this year as x.

We are given that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is equal to three-quarters (or 75%) of the novels she's written this year. In other words, if we let x be the number of novels Regina wrote this year, the problem tells us that 75% of x is equal to 9 novels.\n\nA percentage is just a ratio. To find 75% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.75 (since 75% = 75/100 = 0.75). So in terms of this problem, we can set up the following equation to solve for x:\n\n0.75x = 9\n\nIn order to solve for x, we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\nx = 9 / 0.75\n\nCarrying out this division, we find that x = 12. So Regina has written 12 novels this year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{12}.", "round 1": "Revisiting the problem, our task is to determine the number of novels Regina has written this year. We know that the 9 novels she wrote last year constitute three-quarters (75%) of this year's novels. We've symbolized the number of novels from this year as x. \n\nTo understand these proportions more clearly, realize that \"three-quarters\" or \"75%\" signifies dividing something into four equal parts and taking three of these parts. Therefore, the 9 novels from last year are equivalent to these three out of four parts of x.\n\nLet's write an equation to illustrate that relationship: 0.75x = 9\n\nThe next step involves isolating x on one side. To do so, we need to eliminate this 0.75 that x is currently multiplied by. This involves the principle that what we do on one side, we must do on the other. Therefore, if we divide 0.75x by 0.75, we also have to divide 9 by 0.75 such that the equation maintains its balance.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 0.75, we obtain x = 9 / 0.75.

A quarter, or 1/4, signifies division by four. Since 3/4 represents 3 of these 1/4 segments, we understand that the 9 novels should be divided into 3 parts, each part representing a quarter of this year's total.\n\n2) Divide by the Fraction's Numerator: Divide the 9 novels by 3. This yields 3 novels per quarter.\n\n3) Multiply by the Fraction's Denominator: The denominator in the fraction 3/4 is 4, and this represents the total number of quarters we are considering. Multiply the value from step 2 (3 novels per quarter) by 4 to calculate the total number of novels for the year. Hence, 3 books per quarter * 4 quarters equals 12 books.\n\nIn summary, if 9 books represent 3 quarters of the total, then each quarter contains 3 books, and therefore, 4 quarters (representing the total book count for the year) would contain 12 books. \n\nSo, \\boxed{12} is the total number of novels Regina has written this year.", "round 1": "Through review of all the available solutions provided by various agents, it is clear that each of them approached the problem by using the concept of fractions, percentages and proportions.
