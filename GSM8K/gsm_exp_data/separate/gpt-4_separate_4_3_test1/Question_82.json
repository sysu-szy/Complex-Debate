This includes the cost of cake ingredients, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. The sum of these costs will give us the total cost of the party.\n\nHere's the math:\n\nCost of Cake Ingredients: $12\nCost of Presents: $43\nCost of Decorations: $15\nCost of Invitations: $4\nCost of Goodie Bags: $22\n\nSo by adding: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96. \n\nRound 2: Now that we know the total cost of the party ($96), we need to split this cost evenly three ways, as per the question. The three ways correspond to the three people bearing the expense: Isabelle and her two parents. \n\nSo we will divide the entire cost by 3. \n\nHere's the math:\n\n$96 \u00f7 3 = $32\n\nHence, each person paid $32 for the party. \n\nSo, our answer in the given format is \\boxed{32}.", "round 1": "Examining my solution from the last round, I identify two primary steps involved in solving this problem:\n\nStep 1: Determining the total cost that was shared amongst Isabelle and her parents.

This summed up to $96.\n\nStep 2: After finding the total cost, I divided this sum by three. This division is done because the costs have been equally shared between Isabelle and her two parents. The division of the total cost by three resulted in the calculation $96 \u00f7 3 = $32.\n\nReconfirming my work in this way builds confidence in the accuracy of my prior answer.

This includes the cake ingredients ($12), the birthday presents ($43), the decoration ($15), the invitations ($4) and the goodie bags ($22). Adding these figures together gives us a total cost of $96.\n\nStep 2: This total cost was split equally between Isabelle and her two parents. In order to find out how much each individual contributed, we must divide the total cost by the number of contributors. This means we divide $96 by 3, which gives us a figure of $32.\n\nAll of the other agents have followed these same steps and arrived at the same conclusions, reinforcing the accuracy and correctness of my original solution.
