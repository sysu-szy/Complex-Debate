Replacing S with 2F in our main equation gives us F + 2F + T = 250, simplifying to 3F + T = 250.\n\nNext, since we have T = 2F, we substitute this back into our equation to get: 3F + 2F = 250.\n\nThis simplifies to 5F = 250, then by isolating F, we get F = 250 / 5 = 50.\n\nFinally, to find how many cases T (the third house) needs, we substitute the value we found for F into the equation T = 2F, which gives us T = 2*50 = 100.\n\nSo, the third house will need \\boxed{100} cases of shingles.", "round 1": "After reviewing the other agents' solutions, I have noticed that we have all approached the problem in the same way and obtained the same result. \n\nGiven the relationships between all three houses' needs, we set up our system of equations correctly, and achieved a solution that fits the problem.
