The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and we know that the tattered jeans cost $28. Thus, the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.\n\nNext, let's figure out how much Cole saved from each pair of jeans. According to the problem, Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans, and the rest came from the tattered jeans. Therefore, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2, while the amount saved from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.\n\nSince the amount saved is deducted from the original price, we can calculate the original cost of each pair of jeans before the savings. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.\n\nFinally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of the jogger jeans: $24 - $32 = -$8.

To verify, let's revisit the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the price of the jogger jeans after the sale: \nThe jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. With the tattered jeans priced at $28 after the sale, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.\n\nStep 2: Break down the savings from each type of jeans: \nThe problem tells us Cole saved $6 in total with 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. This means he saved (1/3)*$6 = $2 on the jogger jeans. The remaining savings, which came from the tattered jeans, would be $6 - $2 = $4.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the original price for each type of jeans: \nAfter getting the amount saved for each type, we can calculate the original price by adding the sale price and the respective savings.

That makes the jogger jeans' cost $28 - $6 = $22. \n\nStep 2: Find out the savings from each type of jeans: \nCole has saved $6 in total where 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans.
