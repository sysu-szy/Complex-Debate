{"question": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?", "answer": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary\u2019s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Before Mary started distributing the plants, she had 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges.

Therefore, the total number of plants increases to 98 (80 previous + 18 new = 98).\n\n3) However, Mary decides to give away 1 plant from each window ledge to her friends and family. This would total to 40 plants (1 plant*40 ledges = 40).\n\n4) To calculate the final number of plants remaining with Mary, we subtract the total number of plants she has gifted away from the total number of plants she acquired. As a result, Mary's total number of plants after the generosity will be 58 (98 total - 40 gifted = 58).\n\nUpon checking the accuracy of the calculation, the final answer aligns perfectly with previous deductions.

So, first of all, we will calculate how many plants she has on her window ledges and then add the new plants she received. \n\nSo, 2 potted plants/ledge x 40 ledges = 80 potted plants. \n\nAdding the new plants that Mary received: \n\n80 (on the ledges) + 18 (new) = 98 potted plants.\n\nThis means that currently, before giving any away, Mary has a total of 98 potted plants.\n\nRound 2:\nMary has decided to give away 1 plant from each window ledge. There are 40 window ledges, so she will be giving 40 plants away.\n\nSo we subtract the plants Mary is giving away from the total she has:\n\n98 (total) - 40 (to give away) = 58.\n\nTherefore, after giving away one plant per ledge to her friends and family, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.\n\nSo, \\boxed{58} is the final solution to the problem.", "round 1": "Upon reviewing the solutions provided by the other agents, they all have the same sequence of steps and similar logic. The steps involve the calculation of the total plants initially, adding the newly received plants, and then removing the plants meant as gifts. There is complete consensus amongst the solutions provided and they echo my initial calculation and reasoning. \n\nSo let's update and recheck everything:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial number of plants that Mary has on her window ledges. This will be 2 plants per ledge multiplied by 40 ledges. So, 2*40 = 80 potted plants.\n\nStep 2: Add the new plants which Mary received from the nursery. This will be the initial number of plants that Mary had plus the new ones, which means 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants in total.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the plants which will be given away as gifts. Each window ledge loses one plant and we have 40 ledges in total. Thus, she will be giving away 1*40 = 40 plants. \n\nThe final step will be to subtract the plants which were given out as gifts from the total number of plants originally present: 98 - 40 = 58.\n\nTherefore, the total plants that will be remaining with Mary is indeed  \\boxed{58} and is in line with the findings from the other agents.", "round 2": "After assessing the problem, the solutions offered by the other agents, and my initial conclusion, I uphold my initial resolution.\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1) Initially, Mary has 2 plants on each of her 40 windowsills.

As she has 40 windowsills and donates 1 plant from each, this equates to a total of 40 plants given away.\n\n4) Finally, to discover the number of plants left after Mary gives some away, we have to deduct the total number of plants given away from her total. This results in 98 - 40 = 58 plants remaining.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough examination of my initial calculations and the solutions put forth by the other agents, I maintain that the final solution indicating the number of plants remaining with Mary after she distributes some to her friends and family is \\boxed{58}."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: \n\nMary originally has 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges.
