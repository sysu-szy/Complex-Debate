So, we need to find out the funding per month for the first 5 months.

Hence, there are 50 - 5 = 45 months remaining after the initial 5 months.\n\nThe funding per month for the first 5 months is calculated as the total funding divided by the number of months, i.e., $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.\n\nFor the remaining 45 months, the funding was 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.

The monthly funding during the first 5 months is $100,000/5 = $20,000. \n\n50% more funding each month means he spends $20,000 + ($20,000 * 50/100) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 every month for the remaining research. \n\nTherefore, for the remaining 50 months of research, the total funding needed would be $30,000 * 50 = $1,500,000.\n\nSo, the total cost of his research is the sum of the initial funding, and the funding for the remaining months.
