She then added 3 more slices, which increases the total cake slices to 5 on her plate. This is sorted out by simple arithmetic addition as 2 (original slices) + 3 (added slices) = 5.\n\nNext, Mara tripled the amount of slices she currently has. Given that she has 5 slices, when she triples them, she would now have 15 slices. The mathematic operation here is multiplication, executed as follows: 5 (current slices) * 3 = 15.\n\nMara then ate 2 slices. This translates to subtracting 2 from her current total, which then leaves her with 13 slices. This is achieved via arithmetic subtraction: 15 (total slices) - 2 (eaten slices) = 13.\n\nFinally, while Mara was distracted, her friend managed to steal 5 slices. This reduces the amount on her plate once again, and that means further subtraction. Taking 5 away from her current 13 leaves a final total of 8 slices. The subtraction goes as follows: 13 (total slices) - 5 (stolen slices) = 8.\n\nTherefore, after comprehensively analyzing the problem and executing the appropriate calculations, we find that Mara is left with 8 slices on her plate.

Via simple addition, we get the new total, which is 2+3 = 5 slices of cake.\n\nNext, she tripled the total number of slices present on her plate at that point. Therefore, this process involves multiplication, done as 5*3 = 15 slices of cake.\n\nMara then ate 2 slices of this total amount. Her total slices was thus decreased by 2. To calculate this, we subtract the two slices from the total: 15-2 = 13 slices of cake.\n\nHowever, while vara was not looking, her friend stole 5 slices from her plate. So again, we subtract these slices from the total 13 she had, resulting in 13-5 = 8 slices of cake.\n\nAfter carefully considering each detail in the mathematical problem and keeping in mind the methods used by the other solvers, the number of slices remaining on her plate is 8 slices.

So, the slices of cake on her plate now become 2 (existing slices) + 3 (new slices) = 5 slices.\n\n2. Mara, getting hungrier, then tripled this number. Here, a multiplication operation comes into play. So, the slices on her plate become 5 (current slices) * 3 = 15 slices.\n\n3. From this, Mara ate 2 slices. This is a subtraction operation, so we get 15 (current slices) - 2 (eaten slices) = 13 slices.\n\n4. Lastly, while Mara is distracted, her friend steals 5 slices.

This implies a multiplication operation. 5 slices * 3 equals 15 slices. Hence, there are now 15 slices of cake on the plate.\n\nThen, Mara ate 2 slices from her plate.
