This is because the difference in age between Alice and Erica is the sum of the difference in Alice and Beth's age, and the difference in Beth and Erica's age.\n\nNow, since we know that Erica is 30 years old, we know the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age, which is 12 years.\n\nFinally, to answer the question: \"What is the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, if Erica is 30 years old?\", we can say that the difference is 12 years, which we calculated earlier. \n\nTherefore, the difference between Alice's and Erica's age is \\boxed{12}.", "round 1": "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\nFirstly, the problem describes three people: Alice, Beth, and Erica. It provides age relations among them: \n\n1. Erica  is 30 years old.\n2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica.\n3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth.\n\nThe problem asks for the difference in age between Alice and Erica. \n\nTo get to that, we need to figure out the ages of Beth and Alice first. \n\nBeth's age can be calculated by adding 5 to Erica's age (because Beth is 5 years older than Erica). So, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.\n\nKnowing that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age can be calculated by adding 7 to Beth's age. Thus, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.\n\nNow that we have the ages of Alice and Erica, we can calculate the difference in their ages. Subtracting Erica's age from Alice's gives us 42 - 30 = 12.\n\nAfter careful reevaluation and consideration of other agent's reasoning, my final answer remains:\n\nTherefore, the difference between Alice's and Erica's age is \\boxed{12}.", "round 2": "Revisiting my solution:\n\nFirst, using the given information that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age.

So, using Beth's age which we just calculated, we add 7 to get Alice's age: 35 (Beth's age) + 7 = 42 years.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in age between Alice and Erica by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 (Alice's age) - 30 (Erica's age) = 12 years.\n\nSo, the difference in age between Alice and Erica is 12 years.\n\nI have considered other solutions, found that all of us reach the same numerical value.

So if Beth is 35 years old, we add 7 to 35 to find Alice's age; thus, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. \n\nNow, to find out the age difference between Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's.
