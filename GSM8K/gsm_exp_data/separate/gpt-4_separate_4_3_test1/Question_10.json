The loaf of bread costs $2 each, so we can write down the operation to find the total cost as \"2 (the cost of each loaf) * 3 (the number of loaves)\". The multiplication operation here signifies repeated addition; in other words, we are adding the cost of three separate loaves of bread together.\n\nSo, 2*3 = $6. That's our total cost of 3 loaves of bread.\n\nNext, let's look at the cost of \"2 bagels\". Each bagel costs $1, so we can write down the operation to find the total cost as \"1 (the cost of each bagel) * 2 (the number of bagels)\". Again, the multiplication operation here signifies repeated addition; we are adding the cost of two separate bagels together.\n\nSo, 1*2 = $2.
