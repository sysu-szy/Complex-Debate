The question tells us that the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. This means that the youngest son is 8/2 = 4 years old. Hence, he washes 4 oranges. \n\nSo the total number of oranges washed is 8 (washed by the oldest son) + 4 (washed by the youngest son) = 12 oranges.\n\nSince there were initially 15 oranges, the number of oranges that are left unwashed is 15 (initial total) - 12 (washed) = 3 oranges. \n\nSo, the number of oranges that are left unwashed is \\boxed{3}.", "round 1": "The problem describes two sons of Will washing as many oranges as their age.\n\nFirst, we understand that Will's oldest son is 8 years old. The problem gives us that each of the sons washes as many oranges as their age, so that means the oldest son washes 8 oranges.\n\nNext, we determine the age of the younger son, who is half the age of the oldest son. So, he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. The youngest son washes 4 oranges, because his age is 4 years.\n\nTherefore, the total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 oranges (washed by the oldest son) + 4 oranges (washed by the youngest son) = 12 oranges.\n\nGiven that Will buys a total of 15 oranges, to find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the oranges that have already been washed from the total number purchased.

This calculation is executed by identifying his age with the count of oranges he cleans.\n\nFurther, the youngest son's age is half that of the oldest, which renders him 4 years old. Consequently, he washes 4 oranges since the problem establishes the quantity of washed oranges to be equal to their age.\n\nMoving forward, we can calculate the total number of oranges washed by both sons through simple addition, totalling 8 (eldest son's) + 4 (youngest son's) = 12 oranges.\n\nThe initial quantity of oranges bought by Will is stated to be 15. Hence, the remaining number of unwashed oranges can be computed by subtracting the number of washed oranges (12) from the total oranges purchased (15). \n\nAs a result, we conclude that 15 (total oranges bought) - 12 (oranges washed by sons) = \\boxed{3}.\n\nTherefore, the quantity of unwashed oranges is \\boxed{3}.

This makes him 8/2 = 4 years old, and so he washes 4 oranges. \n\nAdding up the number of oranges washed by both sons results in 8+4 =12 oranges. \n\nWill originally had 15 oranges.

Similar to his older brother, he washes as many oranges as his age - so he washes 4 oranges.\n\nTo find the total number of oranges washed by the sons, we add the oranges washed by the oldest son (8 oranges) to the oranges washed by the youngest son (4 oranges), which gives us 12 oranges.\n\nWe know that Will initially bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the total number of oranges washed by the boys (12 oranges) from the total number of oranges purchased (15 oranges).
