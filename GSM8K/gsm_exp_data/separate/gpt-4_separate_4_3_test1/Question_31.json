This means that we simply need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who boarded the train. So, 120 + 20 = 140 people are now on the train.\n\nAt the second stop, two things happen: 50 people descend from the train, and then twice that number board. This means we need to subtract the number of people who descended and then add the number of people who boarded. Specifically, we have 140 - 50 = 90 people after the first group of people disembark, and then 90 + 2*50 (since twice the number of people who descended, or 100 people, board the train) = 190 people are now on the train.\n\nAt the third stop, 80 more people descend. Therefore, we need to subtract 80 from our current number of passengers.

However, twice the number of those that descended, which is 100 people, board the train. So, the total now becomes 90 + 100 = 190 people.\n\nAt the third stop, another 80 people descend.

However, 100 people (which is double the number of people who descended) board the train. This changes the total number to 90 + 100 = 190 people.\n\nAt the third stop, 80 more people descend, which gives us a final count of 190 - 80 = 110 people.\n\nThus, after considering all these additions and subtractions, I agree with agents 0 and 2 that the correct total number of people remaining on the train after the final stop is \\boxed{110}.

So we begin with a total population of 120 people on the train.\n\nAt the first stop, 20 more people board the train. To find the new total, we add these 20 people to the original 120, which gives us 120 + 20 = 140 people.\n\nAt the second stop, 50 people descended from the train whereas twice that number (100 people) boarded the train. Subtracting the 50 people that descend and adding the 100 people that boarded gives us a new total of 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.\n\nAt the third stop, 80 more people descended. Subtracting these from our previous total, we find that the final total is 190 - 80 = 110 people.\n\nSo the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.
