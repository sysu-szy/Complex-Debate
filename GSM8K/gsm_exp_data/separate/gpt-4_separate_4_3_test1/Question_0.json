We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the number of miles ran by Amber and Micah from the total.\n\nAhito's miles: 52 miles - 28 miles - 8 miles = 16 miles\n\nAs we know, Ahito ran 16 miles. This is a single numerical number.

That information allows us to calculate Micah's total run distance as 8*3.5 which gives us 28 miles.\n\nFinally, to find out how much Ahito must have run, we subtract the combined total of Amber's and Micah's runs from the total ran by all three. This gives us 52 - 8 - 28, which equals 16 miles.\n\nRe-evaluating this method, it's clear that the strategy is sound and the maths correct.
