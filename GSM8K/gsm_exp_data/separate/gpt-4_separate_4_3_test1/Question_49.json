{"question": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards each with 25 cards and 5 boxes of baseball cards each with 40 cards.

This implies that she gives away 350 - 50, which amounts to 300 cards to her students.\n\nGiven that each student gets 10 cards, we find out the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student received.

Thus, the total number of baseball cards she has equals 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards.\n\nIf we add both numbers, we get the total number of sports cards, which equals 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 sports cards.\n\nNext, we need to figure out the number of cards given to her students. Since Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards given away is computed by subtracting these 50 cards from the total number of cards Maria has:\n\n350 total cards - 50 kept cards = 300 cards\n\nFinally, to determine the number of students Maria has, we need to divide the total number of cards she gave away by the number of cards each student received.

She has six decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards. So using the multiplication principle in number theory, these six decks in total would have 6*25 = 150 basketball cards.\n\nNext, Miss Maria also has five boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards. Again, using the multiplication principle, these five boxes would have 5*40 = 200 baseball cards.\n\nSo in total, Miss Maria initially has 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) = 350 cards.\n\nNow, we know that she keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the rest to her students. Therefore, the number of cards given to her students is 350 (total cards) - 50 (cards she keeps) =300 cards.\n\nTo find out how many students she has, we need to take into account the fact that each student got ten cards each. Using the division principle here, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given away by the number of cards each student received.\n\nTherefore, the number of students is 300 (cards given away) / 10 (cards per student) = 30 students. \n\nSo, in conclusion, Miss Maria has \\boxed{30} students.", "round 1": "To solve this problem, we need to break it into smaller steps that require counting the total number of cards Miss Maria has, how many she gave away, and how many students she has. \n\nLet's calculate how many sports cards Miss Maria has. \n\nShe has 6 decks of basketball cards, where each deck has 25 cards.
