{"question": "Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone.

How many seats will Alex need?", "answer": "Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.\nSince 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.\nOut of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.\nIncluding her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.\n#### 319", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: Initial Email Invitations\nAlex begins by inviting 100 people to her event.

The first round ends with 100 seats needed.\n\nIn the second round, each of these 100 invitees says that they will bring 2 of their friends along. Calculating this, it gives us 100 * 2 = 200 additional guests. Therefore, by the end of this round, Alex needs 100 initial invitees + 200 their friends = 300 seats.\n\nIn the third round, Alex calls 10 additional friends personally. This puts the total seats at 300 from email invites and their friends + 10 more from phone invites = 310.\n\nIn the final round, 8 out of the 10 friends Alex calls are bringing their spouses. This means that Alex needs to account for an additional 8 seats. Adding all these up will give a total of 310 total seats so far + 8 additional seats for the spouses = 318 seats. \n\nHence, evaluating all the facts and cross-verifying with the solutions of other agents, my initial solution stands correct.
