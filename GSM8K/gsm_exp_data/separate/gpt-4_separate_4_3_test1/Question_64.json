Since there's 60 minutes in an hour and the horse runs 32 miles per hour, in 30 minutes, the horse will run half that distance. This is just as if you divided the speed (32MPH) by 2 (since 30 minutes is half an hour).\nSo, 32 / 2 = 16 miles.\n\nRound 2:\nNext, recall that Michael's horse consumes 1/2 bale of hay for each mile it runs. Since we know the horse runs 16 miles, that means we need 16 * 1/2 = 8 bales of hay.\n\nRound 3:\nNow that we have the total bales of hay needed, we also know that each bale costs $3. So, the total cost for the hay will be 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.\n\nRound 4:\nLastly, we know Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

The problem stated that for each mile run, the horse eats half a bale of hay. Thus, after running 16 miles, the horse would have eaten 8 bales of hay.\n\nThe next step was to calculate the total cost of the hay consumed by the horse. Given that each bale of hay costs $3, the total cost of the 8 bales of hay eaten by the horse comes to $24.\n\nLastly, we needed to find out how much change Michael had left after purchasing the hay for his horse.
