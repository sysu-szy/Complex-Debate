{"question": "John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. How many bananas does John have?", "answer": "Combining Wednesday and Thursday, John has 4 bananas + 6 bananas = <<4+6=10>>10 bananas.\nOn Friday, he picks 3 * 4 bananas = <<3*4=12>>12 bananas.\nAltogether, John has 10 bananas + 12 bananas = <<10+12=22>>22 bananas.\n#### 22", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "The problem is a basic arithmetic problem that emphasizes addition and multiplication operations. Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirstly, on Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas. So, the number of bananas John has now is 4.\n\nOn Thursday, he adds an additional 6 bananas. So, the number of bananas he has now is the Wednesday's fruits (4 bananas) plus Thursday's fruits (6 bananas). Using addition operation, this give: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) = 10 Bananas.\n\nOn Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 on Wednesday, triple that would be 3 times 4, which simplifies to 12 bananas. \n\nTherefore, by the end of Friday, John has the number of bananas he had by the end of Thursday (10 bananas) plus the number of bananas he picked on Friday (12 bananas). Using addition operation again, this would be: 10 (by end of Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 Bananas.\n\nHence, John has a total of \\boxed{22} bananas.", "round 1": "The question does not need further elaboration as the problem has been solved correctly and all the steps have been appropriately laid out.

Added to Wednesday's collection, John now has a total of 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.\n\nOn Friday, he picks three times the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, John picks 3 * 4 = 12 bananas on Friday.\n\nTo find the total number of bananas John picks in these three days,\nwe add the totals of each day: 10 bananas (Wednesday and Thursday's total) + 12 bananas (Friday) = 22 bananas.\n\nSo, the total number of bananas John picked is \\boxed{22}.", "round 2": "After reviewing the solution from the last round and the other agents' solutions, my answer remains the same.\n\nLet's go through it one more time for clarity:\n\n1.

On Friday, he picks three times the amount of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, he will pick 12 bananas on Friday.\n4.
