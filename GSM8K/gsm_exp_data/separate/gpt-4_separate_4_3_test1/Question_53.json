{"question": "Bob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases.

Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets: So, if we have 2 sheets per room, we will have 2 x 2 = 4 pillowcases per room. For 80 rooms, that is 4 x 80 = 320 pillow cases.\n\n4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases: So, if we have 4 pillowcases per room, we will have 2 x 4 = 8 towels per room. For 80 rooms, that is 8 x 80 = 640 towels.\n\nFinally, we sum up all these individual counts to get the total count of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms:\n\n160 (sheets) + 80 (comforters) + 320 (pillow cases) + 640 (towels) = \\boxed{1200}. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{1200}.\n", "round 1": "After reviewing the solutions offered by all the agents and analyzing the problem carefully, the solution derived by me in the last round is consistent with the solutions provided by the other agents.

So, for 80 rooms, there will be 4*80 = 320 pillow cases.\n- For the towels: Twice as many as pillow cases which is 8 per room.
