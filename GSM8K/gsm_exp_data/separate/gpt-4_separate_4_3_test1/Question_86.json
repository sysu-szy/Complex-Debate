And since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the main website in February can be calculated by multiplying the average daily articles (20) by the number of days in the month (28). Mathematically, this is 20 articles/day x 28 days = 560 articles.\n\nRound 2: \nNow, let's calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February.
