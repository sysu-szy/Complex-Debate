This includes the cocoa, which costs $4.20, the laundry item at $9.45, and the package of pasta at $1.35. By adding these items together, we can find out exactly how much total expenditure the mother had during her shopping trip.\n\nCalculation: 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15 dollars.\n\nRound 2: To find out how much change the cashier gives back to her, we have to subtract this total expenditure from the amount she paid to the cashier which in this case is $20. \n\nCalculation: 20 - 15 = 5 dollars.\n\nThe reasoning behind this calculation is quite simple. When you give a certain amount of money for a purchase, to find out how much money you get back, or your change, you subtract the amount of your purchase from the amount of money you initially gave. \n\nThis is the basic calculation behind transactions and applies to various financial situations, such as purchasing items at a store, calculating how much money you've spent on a certain expense, or figuring out how much you should pay someone back if you've borrowed money from them. \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}.

Let's go through the steps again to confirm:\n\n1. The first step is the summation of all the costs. This consists of $4.20 for the cocoa, $9.45 for laundry, and $1.35 for pasta. Performing the addition for these amounts, we find $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35, which equals $15.00. \n\n2. It's confirmed that the total cost of the items bought by the mother is $15.00. \n\n3. Now we need to find out the change that the mother will receive. We know that the mother has given the cashier $20.00. To get the change, we subtract the total cost of the items, which is $15.00, from the total money given to the cashier, which is $20.00.\n\n4.
