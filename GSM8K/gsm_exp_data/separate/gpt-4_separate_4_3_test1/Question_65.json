{"question": "Sarah went to buy books from the store and spent $300 on the books. If each book was $15 and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, how many books did each child get?", "answer": "Since she spent $300 on the books and each book's cost was $15, she bought $300/$15= <<300/15=20>>20 books.\nIf Sarah gave an equal number of books to each of her children, each kid received 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 books.\n#### 5", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "Round 1: The first thing that we need to figure out is how many books Sarah bought. She spent $300 and each book costs $15, so we can use the equation $300 = 15x$ where x is the number of books. Dividing both sides by 15 gives us $x = 300/15$. \n\nRound 2: Since $300/15 = 20$, we know that Sarah bought 20 books in total. \n\nRound 3: If Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to figure out how many books each child got. We know that there were 20 books in total, so we use the equation $20 = 4y$ where y is the number of books each child got. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us $y = 20/4$.  \n\nRound 4: Since $20/4 = 5$, we know that each child got 5 books. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{5}.

Let's break it down as follows:\n\n1. Initial Calculation: Sarah spent $300 on books. Given that each book cost $15, it's clear that the total number of books she bought was found by dividing the total amount spent by the price per book. i.e., $300 / $15 = 20$. Hence, Sarah bought 20 books in total.\n\n2. Final Calculation: If Sarah uniformly distributed all the books she bought among her 4 children, then each child received a certain number of books. This number can be obtained by dividing the total number of books by the number of kids. i.e., $20 / 4 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that each child received \\boxed{5} books, which is consistent with the solutions provided by other agents.\n", "round 2": "After carefully analyzing my original solution as well as those provided by other agents, I find that the strategies used to arrive at an answer are all similar, leading to a consensus.
