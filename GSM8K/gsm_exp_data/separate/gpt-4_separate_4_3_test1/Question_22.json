{"question": "For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.

So, for the 60 cups of lemonade, he earned 60 (cups) * $0.50 (per cup) = $30.\n\nIn the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour. Thus, the total number of cups he sold in two hours is 10 (cups/hour) * 2 (hours) = 20 cups.\n\nThe price of each cup of lemonade in the next two hours was $0.60.
