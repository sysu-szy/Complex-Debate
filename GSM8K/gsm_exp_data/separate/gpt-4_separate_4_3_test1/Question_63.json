Therefore, 140 quarters would be worth 140 * 0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35.\n\nStep 3: Total amount of money received\n\nAdding the total values from twenties and quarters, the total amount of money she received is 200 + 35 = $<<200+35=235>>235.\n\nNow, we know that she only spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters. \n\nStep 4: Lunch cost from twenties\n\n3/5 of $200 is (3/5) * 200 = $<<3/5*200=120>>120.\n\nStep 5: Lunch cost from quarters\n\nCarrie spent all the quarters which is $35.\n\nStep 6: Total lunch cost\n\nAdding up the parts of the lunch cost, we get 120 from the twenties and 35 from the quarters, which sum up to 120 + 35 = $<<120+35=155>>155.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for her lunch is \\boxed{155}.", "round 1": "To solve this problem, I will first calculate how much money Carrie was given in twenties and quarters, then find how much she spent on lunch.\n\nStep 1: Amount from twenties\n\nCarrie was given ten twenties.

Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total value of the quarters is 140 * 0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35.\n\nStep 3: Total amount received\n\nWhen we add the amount she was given in twenties and quarters together, we get 200 + 35 = $<<200+35=235>>235.\n\nNow, since the question states she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, let's find out how much that totals.\n\nStep 4: Spending from twenties\n\n3/5 of the twenties amounts to (3/5) * 200 = $<<3/5*200=120>>120.\n\nStep 5: Spending from quarters\n\nGiven that she spent all the quarters, this sum is $35.\n\nStep 6: Total amount spent on lunch\n\nWe get this by adding the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters, which is 120 + 35 = $<<120+35=155>>155.\n\nBased on the calculation, the total amount of money Carrie paid for her lunch is \\boxed{155}.", "round 2": "The analysis of the problem from other agents and my own remains consistent.

Therefore, 3/5 of $200 amounts to (3/5) * $200 = $120.\n\nStep 4: Determine the amount she spent from the quarters. \nThe problem mentions that she spent all the quarters on lunch which amounts to a total of $35.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total amount Carrie spent. \nThis would be the sum of the amount spent from the twenties and that from quarters.

That's 10 * $20 = $200.\n\nThe total amount of money from quarters can also be located in a similar manner. We have 140 quarters, and since every 4 quarters make a dollar, we can divide 140 by 4 to ascertain the total value in dollars.

These two forms need to be converted into the same unit (dollars) in order to be added together to find the total amount given to Carrie.
