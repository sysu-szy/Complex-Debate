When we know that four pizzas cost 64 dollars and two of them cost 30 dollars, we need to subtract the cost of the two 30-dollar pizzas from the total amount spent. \n\nReason: The total cost is a sum of the prices of all individual pizzas. By knowing the cost of two of them, we can find out the cost of the remaining two by subtracting the cost of the first two from the total cost because the total cost is the sum of the cost of all pizzas.\n\nCalculations: 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.\n\nRound 2: We now know that the last two pizzas cost 34 dollars together. Since we know that each of the two pizzas costs the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing 34 dollars by 2. \n\nReason: When a quantity that consists of equal parts needs to be divided into equaled valued segments, we divide the total by the number of segments.\n\nCalculations: 34 / 2 = 17.\n\nSo, each of the other two pizzas cost \\boxed{17} dollars.", "round 1": "After reviewing both my solution and the solutions provided by other agents, it is evident that the reasoning, methodology, and final computations are all the same. \n\nIn Round 1, the common first step was to calculate the cumulative cost of the remaining two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the initially stated two pizzas from the total cost. Effectively, we follow this process: \n\n64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars \n\nAnd in Round 2, because we were informed that the price for the remaining two pizzas was equal, we would logically divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the individual cost: \n\n34 dollars \u00f7 2 = 17 dollars\n\nThus, each of the remaining two pizzas costs 17 dollars.\n\nTherefore, there would be no need for an update or alterations to the final answer.

This was achieved by deducting the cost of the first two pizzas ($30) from the overall cost ($64), which led to:\n\n$64 - $30 = $34\n\nNext, we were to determine the cost of each pizza. Since the problem stated that these last two pizzas are priced the same, we proceed by dividing the total cost of the pizzas ($34) by their quantity (2). This calculation provided us:\n\n$34 \u00f7 2 = $17\n\nIn conclusion, both my solution and those of others consistently point to the cost of each remaining pizza being $17.
