{"question": "A family of parents and a child go to the cinema. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.

Therefore, the total cost of the adult tickets is $12 multiplied by 2, which equals \\boxed{24} dollars.\n\nNext, there is one child in the family, and a child ticket costs $8. Therefore, the total cost of the child ticket is $8 multiplied by 1, which results in \\boxed{8} dollars.\n\nFinally, they bought 2 popcorns, each priced at $3. This means the total cost of the popcorn is $3 multiplied by 2, which amounts to \\boxed{6} dollars.\n\nTo find the total amount of money the family spends on their trip to the cinema, we need to add the cost of the adult tickets, the child ticket, and the popcorn together. \n\nTherefore, the total sum is \\boxed{24} dollars + \\boxed{8} dollars + \\boxed{6} dollars. \n\nAdding these together, we find that the family spends a total of \\boxed{38} dollars on their cinema trip.", "round 1": "Certainly, the solution remains unchanged, but let's examine it again to validate it.\n\nTo be clearer, let's systematically address each component of the cost.\n\n1. Adult Tickets: Each adult ticket is priced at $12, and as mentioned, the family comprises two adults. So, the total cost for adult tickets is $12 multiplied by 2.\n   $12 * 2 = \\boxed{24} dollars.\n\n2. Child's Ticket: Only one child is present in the family, and the cost of a child's ticket is $8. Hence, the total cost for the child's ticket is $8.\n    $8 * 1 = \\boxed{8} dollars.\n\n3. Popcorn: The family bought 2 popcorns, each costing $3. So, the total cost for popcorn can be computed as $3 multiplied by 2.\n    $3 * 2 = \\boxed{6} dollars.\n\nFinally, we need to add the total costs from all the three components to get the total amount of money spent by the family.\n\nTherefore, \n\\boxed{24} dollars (Cost of adult tickets)\n+ \\boxed{8} dollars (Cost of child's ticket)\n+ \\boxed{6} dollars (Cost of popcorn)\n= \n\\boxed{38} dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount the family pays for their trip to the cinema is \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 2": "Upon reviewing the problem and the solutions given by the other agents, it is clear that all the solutions align and the math appears to be correct. I will reconsider the problem, taking into account my original response and all of the solutions provided by the agents.\n\n1. We have two adults in the family. Each adult ticket costs $12. This makes the total cost for adult tickets $12 * 2 = $24.\n\n2. There is one child in the family. The child's ticket costs $8. This makes the total cost for the child's ticket $8 * 1 = $8.\n\n3. The family buys 2 popcorns. Each popcorn costs $3. So the total cost for popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.\n\nTo find the total cost the family paid, we simply need to add the cost for the adult tickets, the child ticket, and the popcorn. \n\nThe total cost is $24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child's ticket) + $6 (popcorn) = $38.\n\nHence, based on the calculations and reasoning shared here, the final total cost for the family's trip to the cinema remains \\boxed{38} dollars."}, {"round 0": "The problem can be solved primarily by simple addition, but to make sure we're counting everything, we'll break the total down into several components: the cost of the adult tickets, the cost of the child ticket, and the cost of the popcorns.\n\nFirstly, calculate the total cost for tickets. Since there are two parents, we multiply the cost of the adult ticket by two. $12 times 2 gives us $24.\n\nSecondly, add the cost for a kid's ticket. The kid's ticket costs $8. Adding this to our previous total, we get $24 + $8 which equals $32.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the popcorn. Each popcorn costs $3, they bought 2, so that's $3 times 2, which gives us $6. \n\nIn total: we add $32 for ticket cost to the $6 for the popcorn to get a grand total. $32 + $6 equals $38\n\nTherefore, the family spent a total of \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 1": "Based on the problem and our analysis, I will maintain my initial solution. Each part of the problem calls for simple arithmetic: addition and multiplication. \n\nThe feature by feature approach:\nStep 1: We calculate the cost of the adult tickets. Because there are two adults and an adult ticket costs $12, we multiply 2 by $12 to find the total cost of the adult tickets which is $24. \n\nStep 2: We add the cost of the child\u2019s ticket. The child's ticket costs $8, so by addition, we add $8 to our last subtotal of $24. $24 + $8 would give us $32.\n\nStep 3: We tackle the popcorn. They bought 2 popcorns that is $3 each so that gives us $6 in total for the popcorn.\n\nOur final chance to review and confirm: Are there any other expenses? No. Thus, we add the total for the tickets which is $32 + the total for the popcorn which is $6 and find the family spent $38.\n\nTherefore, after these steps to confirm, the total cost of the family's trip to the cinema is \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 2": "Re-evaluating the problem with the added insights from other agents, I confirm that my initial calculations remain consistent.\n\nLet\u2019s go again through all the expenses:\n\n1. Two adult tickets: Each of these tickets costs $12, hence for two adults the total cost would be 2 * $12 = $24.\n\n2. Single child ticket: As specified in the problem, there is only one child, and the ticket for a child costs $8. So the cost would be 1 * $8 = $8.\n\nAdding these together, we find that the total cost for the movie tickets (both adults' and child's) is $24 + $8 = $32.\n\n3. Two popcorns: Each popcorn is priced at $3. Since they bought two popcorns, the total cost would be 2 * $3 = $6.\n\nHaving determined the individual costs, we now calculate the total expense, which involves adding the cost of the movie tickets and the popcorns together.\n\nSo, the total cost would be $32 (movie tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.\n\nIn conclusion, the complete expense the family incurred in their cinema outing is \\boxed{38} dollars."}, {"round 0": "Round 1: To start, we have to calculate the cost of the cinema tickets for the parents and the child.

For the child's ticket, the price is given as $8. \n\nRound 2: Next, we consider the cost of the popcorn. If the cost per popcorn is $3 and they bought two, then the total cost for popcorn amounts to 2* $3 = $6.\n\nFinal round: Now, to get the total amount the family paid at the cinema, we need to combine the cost of the cinema tickets and the popcorn. This would be the cost of the parents' tickets plus the cost of the child's ticket plus the cost of the popcorn, so we can simply add up these costs: $24 (adults' tickets) + $8 (child's ticket) + $6 (popcorn) = $38.\n\nTherefore, the total amount the family paid at the cinema is \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 1": "Revised Solution:\n\nStarting with the cost the family incurred for the movies:\n\nRound 1: Calculate the cost of the adult movie tickets. Two tickets are needed for the parents, and since each ticket costs $12, the total cost for the adult tickets would be 2 * $12 = $24.\n\nRound 2: The child ticket costs $8. As the family is made up of a pair of parents and one child only, the cost for the child ticket would be 1 * $8 = $8.\n\nThe total cost of the movie tickets can be obtained by adding the cost of the adult tickets and the child\u2019s ticket. This would give  us a total of $24 + $8 = $32.\n\nAfterward, we consider the cost for the popcorn:\n\nRound 3: As given, the popcorn costs $3 each, and since they bought two, we find the total cost by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost of each popcorn, which gives us 2 * $3 = $6.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total cost of their trip to the cinema by adding the cost of tickets and cost of popcorn. This would be $32 (movie tickets) + $6 (popcorn), which adds up to a total of $38.\n\nTherefore, the total amount the family pays at the cinema is \\boxed{38} dollars.", "round 2": "Reevaluating my last round reasoning:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to analyze and calculate each part individually. \n\nStep 1: We start by calculating the cost of tickets for the two adults.

As there is only one child, and a child ticket cost $8, the total cost for the child ticket will be 1 * $8 = $8.\n\nStep 3: Finally, the cost of the popcorn must be calculated. Each popcorn costs $3 and they bought 2 popcorns, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $3 = $6.\n\nThe final step is to sum up all the costs calculated to get the total cost of the family's trip to the cinema. Plugging in the respective values, we will have $24(adult tickets) + $8(child ticket) + $6(popcorn).
