{"question": "Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.\nThe total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.\nSo, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n#### 9500", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "We will solve the problem using the concepts of percentage and addition operations. \n\nLet's start by calculating the extra fees that Mrs. Cruz would have to pay.\n\n1. The 5% brokerage fee of the $350,000 selling price: \n    To get this, we multiply the selling price by 5% (or 0.05 in decimal representation). \n    \tSo, $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500. \n\n2. The 12% transfer fee of the $350,000 selling price: \n    This is calculated in the same way as the brokerage fee. Multiply the selling price by 12% (or 0.12 in decimal form). \n    \tSo, $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000. \n\nNow, to get the total price of the house including the extra fees, we sum up the initial price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.\n\n    So, $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500. \n\nFinally, to know how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price of the house.\n\n    That is, $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.\n\nTherefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n\nThis implies that in this scenario, Mrs. Cruz would not be able to buy the house without exceeding her budget.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is \\boxed{9500}.", "round 1": "After examining the solutions provided by all the agents above, I confirm that my original solution to the problem remains correct.\n\nFirst, I calculated the extra charges that will be added to the sale price: \n\n1.

The 12% transfer fee of $350,000 which is $350,000 * 0.12 equals to $42,000. \n\nThen I calculated the total price of the house. It's calculated by adding the selling price to the brokerage fee and transfer fee. So, $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 equals to $409,500. \n\nLastly, I found out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz budget by subtracting her total budget from the total price of the house. It's calculated by subtraction of $400,000 from $409,500 which equals to $9,500.\n\nHence, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n\nSo, my final answer remains the same: The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
