First of all, we know that the tank's total capacity is 18000 gallons. \n\nOn the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water.

So, Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water into the tank on the first day.\n\nTherefore, on the first day altogether, they pumped 4500 gallons (Wanda) + 3375 gallons (Ms. B) = 7875 gallons into the tank.\n\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, and Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So Wanda pumped 2/3*4500 = 3000 gallons into the tank, and Ms. B pumped 1/3*3375 = 1125 gallons into the tank.\n\nOn the second day, altogether they pumped 3000 gallons (Wanda) + 1125 gallons (Ms. B) = 4125 gallons into the tank.\n\nSo, in total over two days they pumped 7875 gallons (first day) + 4125 gallons (second day) = 12000 gallons into the tank.\n\nHence, for the tank to be full, the remaining gallons of water is total tank capacity - total gallons pumped = 18000 - 12000 = \\boxed{6000} gallons.", "round 1": "Examining the calculations step by step, I found that all of us actually made the similar process. \n\nFirst, we calculated the amount of water each pumped on the first day based on the instructions: Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank and then Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did into the tank. With the total tank capacity being 18000 gallons, the amounts pumped by Wanda and Ms. B were 4500 gallons and 3375 gallons, respectively.\n\nNext, we figured out what each of them pumped on the second day: Wanda filled 2/3 of the previous amount and Ms. B did 1/3 of her previous day's work. This meant Wanda added 3000 gallons (2/3 of 4500) and Ms. B added another 1125 gallons (1/3 of 3375).\n\nAdding those up, they filled 4500 gallons (Wanda on day 1) + 3375 gallons (Ms. B on day 1) + 3000 gallons (Wanda on day 2) + 1125 gallons (Ms. B on day 2) = 12000 gallons.\n\nThe remaining amount to fill the tank to complete capacity is the total capacity of the tank minus the gallons already pumped, which is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons. \n\nSo, all of us arrived at the same final answer, which is \\boxed{6000}.
