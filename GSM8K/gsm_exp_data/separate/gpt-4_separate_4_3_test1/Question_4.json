During the same period, Tom also chops down 2 trees each year. The total number of trees chopped down after 10 years is 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.\n\n3. He starts with 50 trees. So adding the trees he has planted and subtracting the trees he has chopped down gives us 50 initial trees + 100 planted trees - 20 chopped trees = 130 trees.\n\n4. The problem says that 30% of the trees die after 10 years. 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. \n\n5. Finally, subtract the number of trees that have died from the total number.

We first determine the number of trees Tom plants over 10 years. Because he plants 10 trees each year, over 10 years he has planted 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees.\n\n2. Next, we calculate how many trees Tom chopped down over the same period. Since he cuts down 2 trees every year, over the 10 years he has chopped down 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.\n\n3. Tom started with 50 trees. We add the trees he has planted to his initial count and subtract the trees he chopped down. This gives us 50 initial trees + 100 planted trees - 20 chopped trees = 130 trees.\n\n4. However, we know from the problem that after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees this is, we need to calculate 30% of 130 trees, which gives 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\n5. To find out how many trees Tom has left, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before any died.

Calculate the total number of trees he chops down over the same duration: He chops down 2 trees/year, so over 10 years, this comes to 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of trees before deaths: Tom starts off with 50 trees, so adding the trees he plants and subtracting the trees he chops down gives us: 50 initial trees + 100 planted trees - 20 chopped trees = 130 trees.\n\n4. Calculate the total number of trees that die after 10 years: 30% of 130 trees die, which equates to 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\n5. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total before tree mortality to find out how many trees Tom has left: 130 trees - 39 dead trees = 91 trees.\n\nTherefore, applying careful analysis and deductive reasoning, my final answer remains the same.
