Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12. So together, there are 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.\n\nThen, let's figure out how many puppies have spots. Jennifer's spotted puppies equal 3, and Brandon's spotted puppies equal 4. So in total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.\n\nThe problem asks what percentage of all the puppies have spots. This can be understood as asking what part 7 is of 20. To find this, we use the concept of \"percentage,\" which is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The formula to find a percentage is (Part/Whole) * 100.\n\nApplying the formula to our numbers, we get (7/20) * 100 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all puppies that have spots is \\boxed{35}.", "round 1": "Based on my solution and considering the insights and reasoning from the other agents, the answer remains the same.\n\nFirst, we identify the total number of puppies, which we get by adding up the puppies from Jennifer and Brandon.

From the problem, we are told that 3 puppies have spots from Jennifer's litter and 4 puppies have spots from Brandon's litter, giving us a total of 7 puppies with spots.\n\nTo find out the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula for finding percentage which is (Part/Whole) * 100.

It's asking us for the percentage of all puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's 3 spotted puppies added to Brandon's 4 gives us 7 spotted puppies.\n\nThe combined fraction of spotted puppies is therefore 7/20. \n\nFinally, to express this fraction as a percentage, we apply the rule of fraction to percent conversion, which is (fraction x 100)%. \n\nSo, we obtain (7/20) x 100, and this gives us 35.
