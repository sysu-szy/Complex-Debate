After buying both books, she was left with $2 in her budget. \n\nSo, the combined cost of both books must be $12 - $2 = $10.

This method also resulted in each book costing $5.\n- Agent 2 calculated total spent on books first, like Agent 1, and arrived at the same $5 result.\n\nAfter critical review of my and the other agents' solutions, I confirm that my original solution was correct.

So, $16 - $4 = $12. This means that after spending $4, Anna was left with $12.\n\nStep 2: Determine how much Anna has left after buying the books:\nWe are told that after buying the books, Anna had $2 left. So, we need to determine how much money she spent on the books. This can be done by subtracting the remaining money from the amount she had after spending $4. So, $12 - $2 = $10. This means that Anna spent $10 on the books.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the cost of each book:\nSince both books cost her the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on books by the number of books.

This gave $12 - $2 = $10, which was correct.\n\nFinally, in Step 3, I divided the total money Anna spent on the books by the number of books to determine the cost per book.

Anna spent $12 - $2 = $10 for the books.\n\n- In the final step, I divided the total amount spent on books by the number of books to obtain the cost of each book.

This approach was slightly different from mine, but it validates the earlier obtained result as $5 for each book. \n\nAfter reviewing my steps and comparing with my peers, I find my solution to be correct and every approach leads to the same conclusion.
