In fact, the Earth's atmosphere was initially lacking in oxygen and consisted mainly of gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. It was only after the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, that oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. This process took billions of years and occurred long after the formation of the first cells (option C). (D)"}
