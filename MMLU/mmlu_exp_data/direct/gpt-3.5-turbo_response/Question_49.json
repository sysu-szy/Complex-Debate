{"question": "Transpiration is a result of special properties of water. The special properties of water include all of the following EXCEPT: A) cohesion, B) adhesion, C) capillary action, D) hydrophobicity", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "D) hydrophobicity\n\nHydrophobicity refers to the water-repelling properties of certain substances, while transpiration is primarily a result of the cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action of water. Cohesion allows water molecules to stick together, adhesion enables water molecules to stick to different surfaces, and capillary action allows water to move upward through narrow spaces. These properties of water play a crucial role in transpiration. (D)"}
