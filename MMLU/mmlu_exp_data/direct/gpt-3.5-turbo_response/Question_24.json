{"question": " Which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?\n~E \u2283 ~F\nG \u2283 F\nH \u2228 ~E\nH \u2283 I\n~I: A) E \u2283 F, B) F \u2283 G, C) H \u2283 ~E, D) ~H", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "To determine the immediate consequence, we look for a proposition that can be straightforwardly derived from the given premises. \n\nFrom the premises ~E \u2283 ~F and G \u2283 F, we can derive E \u2283 G using Modus Tollens. This is the immediate consequence that follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: A) E \u2283 F (X)"}
