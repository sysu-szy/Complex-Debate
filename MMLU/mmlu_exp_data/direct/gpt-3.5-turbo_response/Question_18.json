{"question": "Of the following solutions, which will have the highest ionic strength? (Assume complete dissociation.): A) 0.050 M AlCl3, B) 0.100 M NaCl, C) 0.050 M CaCl2, D) 0.100 M HCl", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The ionic strength of a solution is calculated by summing the concentrations of all the ions present, taking into account their charges. \n\nFor solution A) 0.050 M AlCl3, it will dissociate into Al3+ and 3Cl- ions, resulting in a total of 4 ions present. The ionic strength will be 0.050 M x 4 = 0.200 (A).\n\nFor solution B) 0.100 M NaCl, it will dissociate into Na+ and Cl- ions, resulting in a total of 2 ions present. The ionic strength will be 0.100 M x 2 = 0.200 (B).\n\nFor solution C) 0.050 M CaCl2, it will dissociate into Ca2+ and 2Cl- ions, resulting in a total of 3 ions present. The ionic strength will be 0.050 M x 3 = 0.150 (C).\n\nFor solution D) 0.100 M HCl, it will dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions, resulting in a total of 2 ions present. The ionic strength will be 0.100 M x 2 = 0.200 (D).\n\nTherefore, the solution with the highest ionic strength is a tie between solutions A, B, and D, each with an ionic strength of 0.200. (A)"}
