The excerpt from the Pennsylvania law shows that there was conflict and debate over the issue of slavery, indicating that a solution had not yet been reached. The framers of the Constitution did not specifically declare that the institution of slavery would be protected in perpetuity, nor did they allow for a state to be exempt from federal laws that went against the state's constitution. Additionally, the Constitution did not declare that slaves could be both citizens and property. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the framers of the Constitution postponed a solution to the problems of slavery. (C)"}
