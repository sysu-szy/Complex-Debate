{"question": "At time 0, five jobs are available for execution on a single processor, with service times of 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 time units. Which of the following is the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs?: A) 50, B) 208/5, C) 92/5, D) 10", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "To calculate the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs, we need to consider the total time it takes to complete all the jobs and then divide by the number of jobs.\n\nTotal service time = 25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 50\n\nTotal completion time = 25 + 40 + 45 + 48 + 50 = 208\n\nAverage completion time = 208 / 5 = 41\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs is 41, which is equivalent to option B.\n\nB) 208/5\n\n(X)"}
