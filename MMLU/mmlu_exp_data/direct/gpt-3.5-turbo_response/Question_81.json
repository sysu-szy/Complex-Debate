{"question": "Instantaneous power in inductor is proportional to the: A) product of the instantaneous current and rate of change of current., B) square of instantaneous current., C) square of the rate of change of current., D) temperature of the inductor.", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "A) product of the instantaneous current and rate of change of current. \n\nThe instantaneous power in an inductor is given by the formula P = i(t) * v(t), where i(t) is the instantaneous current and v(t) is the instantaneous voltage across the inductor. Since v(t) = L * di/dt (where L is the inductance of the inductor), we can rewrite the power as P = i(t) * L * di/dt. This shows that the power is proportional to the product of the instantaneous current and the rate of change of current. \n\n(X)"}
