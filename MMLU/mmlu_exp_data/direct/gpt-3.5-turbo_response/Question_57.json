{"question": "A DNA strand with the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be complementary to the sequence: A) 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032, B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032, C) 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032, D) 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "To find the complementary DNA sequence, we need to match each nucleotide with its complementary base. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).\n\nGiven the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, the complementary sequence would be 3\u2032 GCT AAC 5\u2032. This is because C pairs with G, G pairs with C, A pairs with T, and T pairs with A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032. (B)"}
