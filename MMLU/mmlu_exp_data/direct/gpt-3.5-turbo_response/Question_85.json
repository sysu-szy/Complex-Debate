{"question": "Calculate the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 T.: A) 23.56 GHz, B) 42.58 MHz, C) 74.34 kHz, D) 13.93 MHz", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLarmor frequency = (\u03b3 * B) / (2\u03c0)\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio for a proton (2.675 x 10^8 rad/T*s) and B is the magnetic field strength (1 T).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nLarmor frequency = (2.675 x 10^8 * 1) / (2\u03c0)\nLarmor frequency = 4.257 x 10^7 Hz\nLarmor frequency = 42.58 MHz\n\nTherefore, the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 T is 42.58 MHz.
