{"question": "Which of the following statements about horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture is (are) true?\nI. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.: A) I only, B) II only, C) III only, D) II and III only", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "III. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. This statement is true. Horizontal microarchitecture typically includes microinstructions that have a single opcode specifying the operation to be performed, along with multiple operand specifiers indicating the source and destination of data. This design allows for more flexibility in executing complex instructions.\n\nAnswer: C) III only"}
