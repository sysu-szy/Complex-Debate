{"question": "Which of these temperatures is likely when a container of water at 20\u00b0C is mixed with water at 28\u00b0C?: A) 19\u00b0C, B) 22\u00b0C, C) 30\u00b0C, D) Higher than 30\u00b0C", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "When a container of water at 20\u00b0C is mixed with water at 28\u00b0C, the final temperature will be between 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C. This is because heat will flow from the higher temperature water to the lower temperature water until they reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the most likely temperature after mixing would be around 24\u00b0C, which is between 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C. \n\nB) 22\u00b0C."}
