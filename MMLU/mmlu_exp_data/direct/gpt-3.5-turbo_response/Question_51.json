{"question": "The procedure below is intended to display the index in a list of unique names (nameList) where a particular name (targetName) is found. lf targetName is not found in nameList, the code should display 0.\n PROCEDURE FindName (nameList, targetName)\n {\n  index \u2190 0\n  FOR EACH name IN nameList\n  {\n   index \u2190 index + 1\n   IF (name = targetName)\n   {\n   foundIndex \u2190 index\n   }\n   ELSE\n   {\n   foundIndex \u2190 0\n   }\n  }\n  DISPLAY (foundIndex)\n }\n Which of the following procedure calls can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT Work as intended?: A) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\"], \"Ben\" ), B) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\" ], \"Diane\" ), C) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\", \"Chris\"], \"Ben\"), D) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\")", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The procedure does not work as intended with the following procedure calls:\nB) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\"], \"Diane\" ) - This call should display 0 since \"Diane\" is not found in the list, but the current implementation will display 0.\nD) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\") - This call should display 0 since \"Ben\" is not found in the list, but the current implementation will display 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B, D)."}
