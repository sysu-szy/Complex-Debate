{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWould the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era?: A) Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\", B) Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties, C) No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\", D) No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "C) No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\" (C) \n\nProgressives of that era generally endorsed Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\", which advocated for increased government regulation and intervention in the economy to protect the rights of workers and consumers. The Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, on the other hand, significantly reduced tariffs and was seen as a move towards free trade. Progressives would likely have opposed this tariff as it went against their beliefs in government intervention to promote social welfare and regulate big business."}
