{"question": "What is the most likely outcome of this modification?\n\ufeff\nAn RNA strand that normally produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells is modified to produce a different strand. The original strand is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAACAGA\u2026 \n\nThe modified sequence is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUACCAGA\u2026: A) Absence of the protein, B) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein, C) No change, D) Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The most likely outcome of this modification is B) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein. The reason for this is that the modification results in a change in the amino acid sequence, which can impact the structure and function of the protein. Since the modified sequence is only slightly different from the original, it is likely that the resulting protein will be similar in size but dysfunctional due to the alteration in the sequence. (B)"}
