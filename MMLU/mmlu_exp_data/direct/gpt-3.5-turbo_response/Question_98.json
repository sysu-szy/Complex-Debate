{"question": "Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism. What happened to this \"lost\"water?: A) it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength, B) it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape, C) it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians, D) it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "B) it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape. This is the most widely accepted theory among scientists studying the history of water on Mars. Ultraviolet light from the sun can break apart water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, and the lighter hydrogen atoms are more likely to escape Mars' gravity and be lost to space. This process, known as photodissociation, is believed to have played a significant role in the loss of water on Mars over time. (B)"}
