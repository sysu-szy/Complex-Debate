{"question": "Averaging the output of multiple decision trees helps _.: A) Increase bias, B) Decrease bias, C) Increase variance, D) Decrease variance", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Averaging the output of multiple decision trees helps decrease variance. By combining the predictions of multiple trees, the overall prediction tends to be more stable and less sensitive to small fluctuations in the data, reducing the variance in the model. This is the fundamental principle behind ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosting. (D)"}
