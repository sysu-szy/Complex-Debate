{"question": "Piaget\u2019s theory describes stages of cognitive development ___________.: A) During infancy only, B) From birth to late childhood only, C) From birth through late adolescence only, D) Throughout the life span", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "Piaget's theory describes stages of cognitive development from birth through late adolescence only. This theory outlines four stages of development: the sensorimotor stage (0-2 years old), the preoperational stage (2-7 years old), the concrete operational stage (7-11 years old), and the formal operational stage (11 years old and beyond). Each of these stages covers a specific age range and describes the typical cognitive abilities and milestones achieved during that time period. Therefore, Piaget's theory applies to individuals from birth through late adolescence only (C)."}
