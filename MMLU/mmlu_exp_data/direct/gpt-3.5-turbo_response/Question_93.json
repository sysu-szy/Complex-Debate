{"question": "A motor and a generator are: A) similar devices, B) very different devices, C) forms of transformers, D) energy sources", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "A motor and a generator are similar devices in that they both convert energy from one form to another. However, they do so in opposite ways. A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy to produce motion, while a generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. So, while they are different in terms of their function, they are similar in their ability to convert energy between forms. (A)"}
