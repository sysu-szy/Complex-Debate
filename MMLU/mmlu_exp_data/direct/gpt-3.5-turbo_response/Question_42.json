{"question": "A solution of sulfurous acid, H2SO3, is present in an aqueous solution. Which of the following represents the concentrations of three different ions in solution?: A) [SO32-] > [HSO3-] > [H2SO3], B) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-], C) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-], D) [SO32-] = [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The correct answer is B) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]. \n\nSulfurous acid, H2SO3, is a weak acid that dissociates in water to form the sulfite ion, SO32-, and the bisulfite ion, HSO3-. Since sulfite ion is the conjugate base of a weaker acid compared to bisulfite ion, it will be present in higher concentration. Thus, the concentration of [SO32-] is higher than [HSO3-]. Additionally, the concentration of undissociated sulfurous acid, [H2SO3], will be lower than the concentrations of its conjugate bases, as it is a weak acid that does not fully dissociate in solution. Therefore, the correct order of concentrations is [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-] (B)."}
