{"question": "Electrons in p-type material of a semi-conductor are called as: A) either minority carriers or majority carriers, B) minority carriers, C) majority carriers, D) valance carriers", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "Electrons in p-type material of a semiconductor are called minority carriers. In p-type materials, there are more holes (positive charge carriers) than electrons (negative charge carriers). Electrons in the p-type material are the minority carriers because they are not the dominant charge carriers. (B) minority carriers."}
