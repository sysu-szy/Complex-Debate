{"question": "The vibrations in a longitudinal wave move in a direction: A) along and parallel to the wave, B) perpendicular to the wave, C) Both of these, D) Neither of these", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "A) along and parallel to the wave. In longitudinal waves, the particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave propagation. This means that the vibrations in a longitudinal wave move along and parallel to the wave. (A)"}
