{"question": "A state has enacted an abortion statute in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting interests involved when a woman chooses to terminate a pregnancy by abortion. The state's statute provided that during the first trimester of pregnancy, a woman's right to choose to terminate the pregnancy was paramount and could not be restricted in any manner. After the first trimester, the right of a woman to obtain an abortion was limited to cases where it was demonstrated by a physician that an abortion was necessary to protect the life or health of the woman seeking the abortion. In all likelihood, this abortion statute is: A) constitutional, because the state's statutestrikes a proper balance between the fundamental right of a woman to choose to terminatea pregnancy by abortion and the due processright to life of the unborn child., B) constitutional, because the state's statute issubstantially related to the important stateinterest in protecting the health and life of themother., C) unconstitutional, because the state's statuteimposes an undue burden on the right to obtainan abortion., D) unconstitutional, because it isirrational to impose virtually norestrictions on the right to obtain anabortion in the first trimester whileimposing significant restrictionson the right to obtain an abortionthereafter.", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "D) unconstitutional, because it is irrational to impose virtually no restrictions on the right to obtain an abortion in the first trimester while imposing significant restrictions on the right to obtain an abortion thereafter. The Supreme Court has held that states may regulate abortion procedures in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health after the first trimester, but cannot place an undue burden on a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. By imposing strict limitations on abortions after the first trimester while allowing unlimited access during the first trimester, this statute does not strike a proper balance and may be considered unconstitutional.
