{"question": "Which of the following statements are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models?\n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant: A) (ii) and (iv) only, B) (i) and (iii) only, C) (i), (ii), and (iii) only, D) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The correct statements are (ii) and (iii) only. \n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small - This statement is not true. The diagnostic tests in the Box-Jenkins approach do not specifically indicate whether the model is too large or too small.\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality - This statement is true. The diagnostic tests involve checking for these issues in the model residuals.\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure - This statement is true. If the identified model is appropriate, the autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) for the residuals should not show any additional structure.\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant - This statement is not part of the Box-Jenkins diagnostic testing for ARMA models.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) (ii) and (iii) only."}
