{"question": "In the vibrational-rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule, the R-branch of the spectrum is the result of which of the following transitions?: A) \u0394J = 0; \u0394u = 0, B) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 0, C) \u0394J = 2; \u0394u = 0, D) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 1", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The R-branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum corresponds to transitions where the rotational quantum number J increases by 1, while the vibrational quantum number u remains the same. Therefore, the correct answer is B) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 0. (B)"}
