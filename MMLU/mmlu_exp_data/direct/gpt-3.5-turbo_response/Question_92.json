{"question": "Which of the following statements about datagrams sent by a node in a network using IPv4 protocol is (are) true?\nI. Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\nII. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\nIII. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.: A) I only, B) II only, C) III only, D) II and III", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "II and III are true statements. \n\nDatagrams may be fragmented during routing as they pass through networks with different MTUs. This fragmentation allows datagrams to be transmitted successfully without being limited by the smallest MTU along the path.\n\nDatagrams are reassembled only at the destination node in order to reconstruct the original message sent by the source. The reassembly process is handled by the network layer in the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) II and III. (D)"}
