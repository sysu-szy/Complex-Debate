{"question": "Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, and tutors David for two hours. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. Which of the following statements is true about the transaction above:: A) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75., B) Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75., C) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by more than $75., D) The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "B) Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75.\n\nProducer surplus is the difference between the price the producer is willing to accept and the price they actually receive. In this case, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, so her total opportunity cost for tutoring David for two hours is $100. However, she negotiates a price of $125 for the entire two hours, so her producer surplus is $25.\n\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the price the consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they pay. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. Therefore, David's consumer surplus is $50.\n\nSince the producer surplus ($25) is greater than the consumer surplus ($50), the correct statement is B) Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75.
