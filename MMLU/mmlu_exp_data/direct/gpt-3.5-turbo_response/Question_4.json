{"question": "Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube. Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex. If the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$, then what is the sum of the numbers written on the faces?: A) 18, B) 13, C) 1001, D) 31", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Let the six numbers written on the faces of the cube be a, b, c, d, e, and f. \n\nAt each vertex, the product of the three adjacent numbers on the faces is given by: abc, ade, bcf, bde, cdf, and aef.\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is: abc + ade + bcf + bde + cdf + aef = 1001.\n\nSince each number appears in three different vertices, we can express the sum of the numbers on the vertices in terms of the numbers written on the faces as: 3(a + b + c + d + e +f) = 1001.\n\nGiven that a, b, c, d, e, and f are positive integers, the only way for the equation 3(a + b + c + d + e + f) = 1001 to hold true is if the sum of the numbers written on the faces is 1001/3 = 333.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options. Correct answer: 333 (C)"}
