{"question": "Restate the expression 4(3 + 2) using the Distributive Property. Do not simplify.: A) 4(3) + 2, B) 4(3) + 4(2), C) 20, D) 3 + 4(2)", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The Distributive Property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. Therefore, to restate the expression 4(3 + 2) using the Distributive Property, we distribute the 4 to both the 3 and the 2: \n4(3 + 2) = 4(3) + 4(2) \nTherefore, the answer is B) 4(3) + 4(2) (B)"}
