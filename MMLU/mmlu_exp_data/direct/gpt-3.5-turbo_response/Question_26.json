{"question": "Find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>): A) 1, B) 2, C) 5, D) 11", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The order of the factor group is given by the formula: |(Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>)| = |Z_11 x Z_15| / |<1, 1>|\n\n|Z_11 x Z_15| = |Z_11| * |Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) in Z_11 x Z_15. Since the subgroup is cyclic, the order of the subgroup is equal to the least common multiple of the orders of (1, 1) in Z_11 and Z_15.\n\nThe order of (1, 1) in Z_11 is 11, and the order of (1, 1) in Z_15 is 15. Therefore, the order of <(1, 1)> is lcm(11, 15) = 165.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get |(Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>)| = 165 / 165 = 1\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 1. (A)"}
