{"question": "Instantaneous power in inductor is proportional to the: A) product of the instantaneous current and rate of change of current., B) square of instantaneous current., C) square of the rate of change of current., D) temperature of the inductor.", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "Instantaneous power in inductor is proportional to the product of the instantaneous current and rate of change of current. This can be derived from the formula for power in an inductor which is P = 0.5*L*di\u00b2/dt\u00b2. The power can thus be seen to depend on the current (i) and the rate at which that current is changing (di/dt). Hence, the answer is (A)."}
