{"question": "Of the following solutions, which will have the highest ionic strength? (Assume complete dissociation.): A) 0.050 M AlCl3, B) 0.100 M NaCl, C) 0.050 M CaCl2, D) 0.100 M HCl", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The ionic strength of a solution is determined by the molarity (M) of the solution and the charge of the ions. More specifically, it is the sum of the molar concentrations of all the ions in the solution, each multiplied by the square of the charge number of that ion. \n\nFor each of the solutions:\n\nA) 0.050 M AlCl3 dissolves into 4 ions: 1 Al3+ ion and 3 Cl- ions. The ionic strength I = 0.050*1*3^2 + 0.050*3*1^2 = 0.600\n\nB) 0.100 M NaCl dissolves into 2 ions: 1 Na+ ion and 1 Cl- ion. The ionic strength I = 0.100*1*1^2 + 0.100*1*1^2 = 0.200\n\nC) 0.050 M CaCl2 dissolves into 3 ions: 1 Ca2+ ion and 2 Cl- ions. The ionic strength I = 0.050*1*2^2 + 0.050*2*1^2 = 0.300\n\nD) 0.100 M HCl dissolves into 2 ions: 1 H+ ion and 1 Cl- ion. The ionic strength I = 0.100*1*1^2 + 0.100*1*1^2 = 0.200\n\nSolution A) 0.050 M AlCl3 has the highest ionic strength. (A)"}
