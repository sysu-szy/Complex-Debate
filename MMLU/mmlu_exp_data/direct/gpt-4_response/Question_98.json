{"question": "Some of Mars'water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps and some was lost due to solar wind stripping but much of the original water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism. What happened to this \"lost\"water?: A) it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength, B) it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape, C) it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians, D) it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "Most of the lost water from Mars is believed to have been broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by the intense ultraviolet light from the sun. The hydrogen, being light, would have then been lost to space through thermal escape. This postulated theory is supported by the observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape."}
