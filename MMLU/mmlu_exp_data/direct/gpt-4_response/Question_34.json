{"question": "Which of these temperatures is likely when a container of water at 20\u00b0C is mixed with water at 28\u00b0C?: A) 19\u00b0C, B) 22\u00b0C, C) 30\u00b0C, D) Higher than 30\u00b0C", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "When two bodies of water in a closed system are mixed, the resulting temperature will be somewhere between the initial temperatures of the two bodies of water. It won't be colder than the colder one or hotter than the hotter one, assuming no other sources of heat or cooling.\n\nIn this case, with the two given temperatures of 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C, the final temperature of the mixed water will be somewhere between 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C. It will not be colder than 20\u00b0C or hotter than 28\u00b0C.\n\nSo, the resulting temperature should be (B) 22\u00b0C."}
