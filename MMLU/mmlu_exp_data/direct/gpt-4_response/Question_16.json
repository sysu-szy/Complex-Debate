{"question": "Bronchial breathing is characterized by: A) Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration, B) Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration, C) Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration, D) Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "Bronchial breathing is characterized by the expiratory component being louder and longer. This deviates from normal breath sounds where the inspiratory phase is usually longer than the expiratory. Additionally, in bronchial breathing, there is typically no gap between inspiration and expiration. So, the correct answer is B) Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration.\n\nBronchial breathing is heard in pathological conditions where the lung tissue, which usually insulates the sound, becomes airless and allows the sound from the upper airway to be transmitted more clearly to the chest wall. Examples of such conditions include lung consolidation from pneumonia, lung collapse (atelectasis), or lung tumors.\n\nThe choice D) is not correct because it's a repeat of option B. Both A) and C) are also not right as they suggest that the inspiratory component is louder and longer, contrary to what characterizes bronchial breathing.\n\nAnswer: (B)"}
