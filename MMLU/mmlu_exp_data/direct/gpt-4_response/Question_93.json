{"question": "A motor and a generator are: A) similar devices, B) very different devices, C) forms of transformers, D) energy sources", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "A motor and a generator are similar devices because they both function on the principle of electromagnetic induction, albeit in reverse ways. A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, whereas a generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Therefore, the answer is (A) similar devices."}
