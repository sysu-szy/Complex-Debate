{"question": "Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, and tutors David for two hours. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. Which of the following statements is true about the transaction above:: A) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75., B) Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75., C) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by more than $75., D) The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Consumer surplus is calculated as the difference between the maximum price the consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they pay. Here, David's consumer surplus is $175 (what he is willing to pay) minus $125 (what he actually pays), giving a consumer surplus of $50.\n\nProducer surplus is calculated as the difference between the minimum price at which the producer is willing to sell and the actual selling price. Here, Elsa's producer surplus is $125 (price paid) minus $100 ($50 per hour for 2 hours), resulting in a producer surplus of $25.\n\nHence, the answer is (A) Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75. To be precise, consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by $25. This is calculated by subtracting the producer surplus ($25) from the consumer surplus ($50)."}
