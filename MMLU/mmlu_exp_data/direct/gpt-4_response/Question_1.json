{"question": "A chemical company's plant was located in a residential community. The manufacturing process used at the plant generated a toxic chemical as a by- product. The chemical was stored in a state-of-the- art tank on the site before being moved to an off-site disposal facility. The on-site storage arrangement conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations. However, the storage of the toxic chemical created a foreseeable and highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised. Despite the chemical company's proper use and care of the storage tank, toxic fumes escaped from the tank and made residents of the area seriously ill. No state or federal statutes address the issue of the company's liability. In an action by one of the affected residents against the chemical company, will the resident be likely to prevail?: A) No, because the chemical company conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations., B) No, because the chemical company used a state-of-the-art storage tank., C) Yes, because the chemical company is strictly liable in tort for any harm caused by the toxic chemicals it produced., D) Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The resident would likely prevail against the chemical company. Despite the fact that the company took reasonable care and observed applicable regulations, they stored toxic chemicals in a residential area and this resulted in harm to the residents. The key factor here is that the harm was foreseeable, and the risk was significant even when reasonable care was taken by the company. This suggests that the company is strictly liable in tort - which is a legal doctrine holding parties responsible for their actions regardless of their intent or degree of care - for any harm caused by the toxic chemicals it produced. Hence, the answer is C) Yes, because the chemical company is strictly liable in tort for any harm caused by the toxic chemicals it produced. (C)"}
