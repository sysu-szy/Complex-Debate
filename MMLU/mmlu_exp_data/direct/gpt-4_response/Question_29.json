{"question": "These are stores designed to kill off the competition and are characterized by narrow but very deep product assortment, low prices, and few to moderate customer services:: A) Speciality stores., B) Limited line retailers., C) Category-killer stores., D) Superstores.", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The correct answer is (C) Category-killer stores. Category killers are specialized superstores or \"big box stores\" that offer a deep assortment of merchandise in a particular category at a low price. Examples include Home Depot, Barnes & Noble, and Best Buy. They are called \"category killers\" because they often outperform and thus \"kill\" smaller, specialist retailers in the category they operate in, due to their ability to leverage large buying power to negotiate low prices with suppliers, which they can then pass on to customers."}
