{"question": " Which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises?\n~E \u2283 ~F\nG \u2283 F\nH \u2228 ~E\nH \u2283 I\n~I: A) E \u2283 F, B) F \u2283 G, C) H \u2283 ~E, D) ~H", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The immediate logical consequence is D) ~H.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nGiven H \u2228 ~E and H \u2283 I, the non-occurrence of I (~I) implies that H did not occur, because if H had occurred, I would have occurred too (according to the premise H \u2283 I). So, if I did not occur (~I), H did not occur either, giving us ~H.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D)."}
