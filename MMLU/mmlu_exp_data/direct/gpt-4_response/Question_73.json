{"question": "Which is a characteristic unique to angiosperms?: A) Wind-borne pollen, B) A dominant sporophyte life cycle, C) Alteration of generations, D) Double fertilization", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Each of the options A, B, C actually applies to several groups of plants, not just angiosperms. For instance, wind-borne pollen is observed in various plant groups including some gymnosperms and ferns. A dominant sporophyte life cycle is common throughout vascular plants which include ferns, clubmosses, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Alteration of generations is a trait common in most plant species, from algae to flowering plants. \n\nOption D, however, is unique to angiosperms. Double fertilization is a process that happens when one pollen grain produces two sperm cells. One of these fertilizes the egg to produce the zygote (which eventually becomes the embryo), while the other fertilizes two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm (which will nourish the developing embryo). This feature is not observed in any other group of plants. Therefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nSo, the characteristic unique to angiosperms is: (D) Double fertilization."}
