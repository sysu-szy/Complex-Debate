{"question": "Which of the following agents will induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote?: A) Penicillin, B) Colchicine, C) Tetracycline, D) Puromycin", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "Polyploidy, the presence of multiple sets of chromosomes in a cell, can be induced artificially in various organisms. Of the options given, colchicine is a mitotic inhibitor used to induce polyploidy. It prevents the formation of the mitotic spindle which is necessary for cell division thereby leading to doubling up of chromosome numbers. The other agents listed - Penicillin, Tetracycline, and Puromycin - are antibiotics that target bacterial cells but do not induce polyploidy. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Colchicine."}
