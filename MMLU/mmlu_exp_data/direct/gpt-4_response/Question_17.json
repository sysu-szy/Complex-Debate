{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into being a new party, born of the nation's sense of justice. We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWhich of the following regulatory laws was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle?: A) The Clayton Antitrust act, B) The Hepburn Act, C) The Sherman Antitrust Act, D) The Pure Food and Drug Act", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, which was published in 1906, exposed unsanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry and led to public outcry about food safety.
