{"question": "Find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>): A) 1, B) 2, C) 5, D) 11", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The order of a factor group (G/H) is equal to the order of the group G divided by the order of the subgroup H. The order of a group G = Z_n x Z_m is n*m. Here, the group G = Z_11 x Z_15 has order 11*15 = 165. \n\nThe subgroup H = <(1,1)> is generated by the element (1,1), and the order of this subgroup is the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15. The LCM of 11 and 15 is 165. \n\nSo, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/<(1,1)> is 165/165 = 1. \n\nSo the correct answer is A) 1. \n\nThe explanation is the definition of the order of a factor group and how it's calculated from the orders of the original group and its subgroup. The original group has order 11*15 because it's a Cartesian product of two cyclic groups with orders 11 and 15, and the order of a Cartesian product of groups is the product of their orders. The subgroup has order 165 because it's generated by the element (1,1), and the order of a cyclic group generated by an element is the least common multiple of the orders of the groups in the Cartesian product that this element comes from. \n(A)"}
