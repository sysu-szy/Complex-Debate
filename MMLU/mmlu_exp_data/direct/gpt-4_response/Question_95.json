{"question": "Which of the following statements about horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture is (are) true?\nI. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.: A) I only, B) II only, C) III only, D) II and III only", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The correct answer is (B) II only.\n\nI. It is not necessarily true that programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architect. It depends on the complexity of the program and the specific implementation of the architecture.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are indeed unencoded. This means that each bit in the instruction directly controls a certain aspect of the hardware, giving horizontal microarchitectures a high degree of parallelism and flexibility.\n\nIII. This statement is generally not true. Horizontal microinstructions usually contain several opcodes with each operation being controlled by a specific bit in the instruction, not a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. \n\nTherefore, among the provided options, only statement II is true for horizontal microarchitecture.
