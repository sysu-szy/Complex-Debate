{"question": "Which of the following statements is NOT correct about ancient Earth?: A) Earth was formed about 4? billion years ago., B) Amino acid synthesis could have been stimulated by volcanic eruption., C) The first cells formed about 3? billion years ago, according to the fossil record., D) The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules.", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "D) The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules.\n\nThis statement is not correct because in fact, the presence of free oxygen would have prevented the formation of organic molecules. Organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life, are thought to have formed in a 'reducing' atmosphere, one lacking oxygen. Free oxygen is a reactive element that can break down organic molecules, and so its presence on early Earth would have hindered, not helped, the origin of life. Therefore, it's generally believed that a significant amount of oxygen didn't appear in the Earth's atmosphere until photosynthesizing organisms evolved and began to produce it. (D)"}
