{"question": "Which of the following statements does not describe 'nations'?: A) Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups., B) Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies., C) Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state., D) Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups.", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "(C) Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state. This statement does not accurately describe nations because a nation is primarily a social and psychological construct based on shared aspects like culture, language, values and history. While nations often exist within the boundaries of a recognized state, there are also \"stateless nations\" like the Kurds, who exist across multiple state boundaries. Furthermore, a state can contain multiple nations within its borders. Therefore, the definition of a nation goes beyond just physical boundaries and borders. (C)"}
