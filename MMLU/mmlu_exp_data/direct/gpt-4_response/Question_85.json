{"question": "Calculate the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 T.: A) 23.56 GHz, B) 42.58 MHz, C) 74.34 kHz, D) 13.93 MHz", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The Larmor frequency, also known as the gyrofrequency, of a proton in a magnetic field is given by the equation:\n\nfrequency = \u03b3*B\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nFor a proton, \u03b3 is approximately 42.58 MHz/T.\n\nTherefore, in a magnetic field of 1 T, the Larmor frequency of a proton would be:\n\nfrequency = \u03b3*B = 42.58 MHz/T * 1 T = 42.58 MHz\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 42.58 MHz."}
