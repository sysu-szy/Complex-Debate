{"question": "Transpiration is a result of special properties of water. The special properties of water include all of the following EXCEPT: A) cohesion, B) adhesion, C) capillary action, D) hydrophobicity", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Special properties that facilitate transpiration, which is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere, include the following: \n\nA) Cohesion: This allows water molecules to stick together and move as a continuous stream.\nB) Adhesion: This helps water molecules to adhere to the xylem walls even against gravity.\nC) Capillary action: This helps water to travel from roots to the leaves against gravity.\n\nHowever, D) Hydrophobicity is not considered a special property that facilitates transpiration. Hydrophobic substances are those that repel water molecules. This property does not aid the process of transpiration in any way. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Hydrophobicity. (D)"}
