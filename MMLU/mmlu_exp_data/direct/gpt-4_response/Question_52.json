{"question": "Restate the expression 4(3 + 2) using the Distributive Property. Do not simplify.: A) 4(3) + 2, B) 4(3) + 4(2), C) 20, D) 3 + 4(2)", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition states that a(b + c) equals ab + ac. Therefore, using the Distributive Property, the expression 4(3 + 2) becomes 4(3) + 4(2). This shows that the answer is B) 4(3) + 4(2) (B)."}
