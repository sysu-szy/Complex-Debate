{"question": "Which of the following karyotypes is not compatible with survival to birth?: A) 47,XY,+13, B) 47,XX,+18, C) 47,XY,+21, D) 45,Y", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "D) 45,Y is not compatible with survival to birth. To understand this, you need to understand what these karyotypes represent. Human cells typically have 46 chromosomes - 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males). These karyotypes all describe changes to this typical arrangement. \n\nA) 47,XY,+13 represents a male (XY) with an extra copy of chromosome 13, which results in Patau Syndrome. The survival rate is very low, but survival until birth is often possible.\n\nB) 47,XX,+18 represents a female (XX) with an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in Edwards Syndrome. Though this syndrome is severe, children with it can be born alive.\n\nC) 47,XY,+21 represents a male (XY) with an extra copy of chromosome 21, which results in Down Syndrome. Individuals with Down syndrome are able to live into adulthood with this condition.\n\nBut D) 45,Y represents a situation where not only is there a missing chromosome (we'd expect 46 total), but the missing chromosome is an X sex chromosome. A Y chromosome alone cannot sustain development. Therefore, embryos with this karyotype don't survive to birth. \n\nTherefore, while all of these karyotypes represent serious genetic abnormalities, only (D) 45,Y is absolutely not compatible with survival to birth."}
