Defense spending has consistently surged in response to major wars, such as World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. While military expenditure typically decreases in peacetime, it rarely returns to its previous levels, in part due to ongoing military commitments, the legacy of past wars, and an evolving geopolitical landscape. This pattern is reflected in federal budget data collected by the Office of Management and Budget. (B)"}
