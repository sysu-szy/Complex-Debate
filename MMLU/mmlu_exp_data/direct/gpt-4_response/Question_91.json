{"question": "The two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are:: A) actin and troponin., B) actin and myosin., C) troponin and tropomyosin., D) myosin and tropomyosin.", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "The two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are actin and myosin. Muscle contraction occurs as myosin heads bind to actin filaments and apply force, pulling the filaments and thus, shortening the muscle. Troponin and tropomyosin, on the other hand, are not contractile proteins but rather regulatory proteins that control the binding of actin and myosin. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) actin and myosin."}
