{"question": "In the vibrational-rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule, the R-branch of the spectrum is the result of which of the following transitions?: A) \u0394J = 0; \u0394u = 0, B) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 0, C) \u0394J = 2; \u0394u = 0, D) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 1", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The R-branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule corresponds to a change in the rotational quantum number (J) by +1. This would yield a \u0394J = 1. On the other hand, \u0394u typically refers to the change in the vibrational quantum number, which is not considered in the R-branch. Therefore, the correct choice is B) \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 0. That means the R-branch corresponds to a transition where the quantum rotational number increases by one unit and the quantum vibrational number remains unchanged. (B)"}
