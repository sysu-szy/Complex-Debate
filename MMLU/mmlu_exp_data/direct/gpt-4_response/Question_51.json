{"question": "The procedure below is intended to display the index in a list of unique names (nameList) where a particular name (targetName) is found. lf targetName is not found in nameList, the code should display 0.\n PROCEDURE FindName (nameList, targetName)\n {\n  index \u2190 0\n  FOR EACH name IN nameList\n  {\n   index \u2190 index + 1\n   IF (name = targetName)\n   {\n   foundIndex \u2190 index\n   }\n   ELSE\n   {\n   foundIndex \u2190 0\n   }\n  }\n  DISPLAY (foundIndex)\n }\n Which of the following procedure calls can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT Work as intended?: A) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\"], \"Ben\" ), B) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\" ], \"Diane\" ), C) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Ben\", \"Chris\"], \"Ben\"), D) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\")", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The procedure calls that can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does not work as intended is D) FindName ([\"Andrea\", \"Chris\", \"Diane\"], \"Ben\"). This is because the name \"Ben\" is not present in the given list, so according to the procedure description, the code should display 0. However, according to the given code, it will display the index of the last checked name instead of 0, because while looping through the list, its foundIndex resets to 0 every time it checks a name that does not match targetName, irrespective of whether targetName is in the list or not. Thus, the code will not display 0 if targetName is not found in the nameList, which contradicts the procedure description. (D)"}
