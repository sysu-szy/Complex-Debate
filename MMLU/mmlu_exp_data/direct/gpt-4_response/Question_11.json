{"question": " Select the best translation into predicate logic: All robots are artifacts.: A) (\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx), B) (\u2200x)(Ax \u2022 Rx), C) (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax), D) (\u2200x)(Rx \u2022 Ax)", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The best translation into predicate logic for the statement \"All robots are artifacts\" is C) (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax). This is because in predicate logic, the conditional operator (\u2283) is used to translate \"all\" or \"every\" in statements like this one. It reads as \"for all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact\", which accurately reflects the original sentence. So, the correct answer is (C)."}
