{"question": "Stan is out having a few beers with some friends. Which of the following will be DECREASED if Stan only consumes 1 beer?: A) arousal, B) erection, C) inhibition, D) orgasm", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "Alcohol acts as a depressant which means it slows down brain functioning and neural activity. While a small amount of alcohol can potentially lower inhibitions, meaning people might feel more relaxed or confident, alcohol does not increase arousal or help maintain an erection. However, when it comes to only 1 beer, the effect may not be significant. But considering the options given, the right answer would likely be (C) inhibition. As some studies suggest, low doses of alcohol appear to decrease inhibitions which can make people seem more sociable or daring."}
