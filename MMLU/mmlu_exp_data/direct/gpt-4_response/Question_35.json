{"question": "Electrons in p-type material of a semi-conductor are called as: A) either minority carriers or majority carriers, B) minority carriers, C) majority carriers, D) valance carriers", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "In p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. This is because in p-type materials, the concentration of holes (which are positively charged) is increased by adding impurities that accept electrons (known as acceptor dopants). This leaves behind a positively charged \"hole\". Therefore, the electrons become the minority carriers, as there are fewer of them compared to the number of holes. Hence, the answer is (B) minority carriers."}
