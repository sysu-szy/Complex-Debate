{"question": "A cannon is mounted on a truck that moves forward at a speed of 5 m/s. The operator wants to launch a ball from a cannon so the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the level surface. The muzzle velocity of the cannon is 50 m/s. At what angle from the horizontal should the operator point the cannon?: A) 5\u00b0, B) 41\u00b0, C) 45\u00b0, D) 49\u00b0", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The angle at which the operator should point the cannon to maximize the distance a projectile travels is independent of the initial velocity of the projectile. This means that even if the truck is moving forward, the angle with the best range will not change. This optimal angle is 45 degrees from the horizontal. Therefore, the correct answer is C) 45\u00b0. This fact comes from the mathematical derivation of the equation for the range of a projectile in physics.\n\nThe range equation is given by: R = v\u00b2sin(2\u03b8)/g, where v is the initial velocity of the projectile, \u03b8 is the angle it is launched at, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The range is maximized when sin(2\u03b8) is maximized, and sin(2\u03b8) is at its maximum (1) when 2\u03b8=90\u00b0, or \u03b8=45\u00b0. So, the range of a projectile is maximized when it is launched at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizontal.\n \nThus, the answer is (C) 45\u00b0."}
