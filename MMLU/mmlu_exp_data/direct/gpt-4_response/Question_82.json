{"question": "The following has been shown to be the most effective means of symptom reduction for obsessive-compulsive disorder:: A) Dialectical behavior therapy, B) Antidepressant medications, C) Exposure and response prevention therapy, D) Combination of exposure and response prevention therapy and antidepressant Medications", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The most effective means of symptom reduction for obsessive-compulsive disorder has been found to be a combination of exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy and antidepressant medications (particularly SSRIs). ERP is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves the patient confronting their fears and refraining from the compulsion to reduce that fear. Antidepressant medications, on the other hand, can help manage the chemical imbalances that contribute to OCD. When used together, they tend to have a synergistic effect, resulting in greater symptom reduction than either treatment alone. Therefore, the answer is (D) Combination of exposure and response prevention therapy and antidepressant Medications."}
