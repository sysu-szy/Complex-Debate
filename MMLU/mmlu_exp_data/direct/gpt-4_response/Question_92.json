{"question": "Which of the following statements about datagrams sent by a node in a network using IPv4 protocol is (are) true?\nI. Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\nII. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\nIII. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.: A) I only, B) II only, C) III only, D) II and III", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "II. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing - This is true. As datagrams travel through a network, they may need to be fragmented, or broken down into smaller pieces, to fit within the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of different network links.\n\nIII. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination - This is also true. The fragmented pieces of the datagram are not reassembled until they reach their final destination.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) II and III. \n\nI. Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination - This is not necessarily true. Datagrams at the source can be the size of the largest MTU of the source's link. If a datagram's size is larger than the MTU of any link in its path, it may be fragmented to fit within that link's MTU. The fragments will be reassembled at the destination. So, statement I is not generally true in the case of IPv4 protocol."}
