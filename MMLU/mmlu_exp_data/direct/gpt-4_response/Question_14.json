{"question": "What is the most likely outcome of this modification?\n\ufeff\nAn RNA strand that normally produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells is modified to produce a different strand. The original strand is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAACAGA\u2026 \n\nThe modified sequence is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUACCAGA\u2026: A) Absence of the protein, B) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein, C) No change, D) Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The accuracy of the outcome highly depends on where in the protein the modification occurs and whether it results in a meaningful change in the protein's amino acid sequence. Changing a single nucleotide can lead to a different amino acid being inserted into the protein during synthesis, leading to a single amino acid substitution. This can have various effects depending on the exact nature of the change: it might not significantly affect the protein's function (if the new amino acid performs a similar role to the initial one), result in a completely non-functional protein, or may even result in a protein with a different function. Without detailed information on the exact nature of this transmembrane protein and its structure, it's challenging to predict the specific outcome accurately. However, it's reasonable to expect that there would likely be some change in result. Therefore, the most probable of these options would be B) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein.
