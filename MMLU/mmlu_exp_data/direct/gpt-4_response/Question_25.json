Grunig and Hunt are known for their influential works in the field of public relations, including the Four Models of Public Relations. They introduced the concept of 'publics' and suggested that organizations should only focus on those publics who are affected by the decisions of the organization. These publics are known as 'active publics.' Therefore, if a public is not affected by an organization, there is no need to prioritize communication with that public. (D)"}
