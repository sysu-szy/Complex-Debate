{"question": "A nonsense mutation involves:: A) a regulatory sequence., B) an AG splice acceptor site., C) the creation of a different amino acid., D) the creation of a stop codon.", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "A nonsense mutation involves the creation of a stop codon. During protein synthesis, if a DNA codon that usually codes for an amino acid is mutated in such a way that it now specifies a stop command, it is termed as a nonsense mutation. Instead of adding an amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, the synthesis stops prematurely, often resulting in a nonfunctional protein. (D)"}
