{"question": "Which of the following is not a common criticism of Securitization?: A) A loose and broad conceptualization of security can lead to vagueness and a lack of conceptual and analytical coherence., B) When the securitizing actor is not the state, it can be unclear what would constitute an extraordinary measure., C) The model relies on a definition of distinctive political and security realms, which are not always clearly defined., D) The theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security.", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "All of the given options A, B, C, and D are indeed a common criticism of Securitization. Hence, there is no option that can be said as 'Not' a common criticism of Securitization. \n\nTo delve deeper:\n\nA) Critics argue that a loose and broad conceptualization of security can lead to vagueness and a lack of conceptual and analytical coherence. \n\nB) They also criticise the aspect that when the securitizing actor is not the state, it can be unclear what would constitute an extraordinary measure. Who, for instance, can legitimately declare a security threat when non-state actors are involved?\n\nC) The model is also criticised for relying on a definition of distinctive political and security realms, which are not always clearly defined, and where the line is blurry.\n\nD) And finally, the theory of securitization is seen by critics as lacking coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security.\n\nSo, the answer here would be E) None of the above, although it is not given as an option.
