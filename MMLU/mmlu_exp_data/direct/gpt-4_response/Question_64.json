{"question": "Castration in adulthood: A) will produce a high voice because of decreased testosterone production., B) will produce a high voice because of the pain that accompanies the procedure., C) will not produce a high voice because the larynx has already grown., D) will not produce a high voice because castration does not affect testosterone production.", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "Castration in adulthood will not result in a higher voice because the larynx, or the voice box, has already grown and matured under the influence of testosterone during puberty. This is not to say that testosterone does not play any role post-puberty, but its role in determining the pitch of the voice is largely concluded after puberty. Therefore, reducing testosterone levels in adults through castration would not significantly alter the voice pitch. Thus, the correct response is C) will not produce a high voice because the larynx has already grown. (C)"}
