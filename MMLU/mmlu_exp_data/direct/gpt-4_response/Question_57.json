{"question": "A DNA strand with the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be complementary to the sequence: A) 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032, B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032, C) 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032, D) 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The complementary DNA strand to 5' CGA TTG 3' would replace C with G, G with C, A with T, and T with A. Accordingly, the correct complementary sequence would be: 5' GCT AAC 3'. This process is based on the principle of base pairing in DNA where adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. Hence, the answer is B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032. (B)"}
