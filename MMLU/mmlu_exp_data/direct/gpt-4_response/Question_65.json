{"question": "What case did President Eisenhower make against the 'military-industrial complex' in his farewell speech?: A) That the capitalist search for profits was the leading cause of armed conflict, B) That the United States no longer needed to be militarily strong, C) That military spending gave the arms industry unwarranted influence on politics and government, D) That private companies would undermine the role of the Armed Forces", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "President Eisenhower made the case against the 'military-industrial complex' in his farewell speech by arguing that military spending gave the arms industry unwarranted influence on politics and government. He was concerned that the continuation of a large peacetime military infrastructure and the influence of the defense industry could lead to the erosion of democratic processes and civil liberties by driving defense policies to benefit the industry instead of the national interest. He did not argue that capitalism led to conflict, that the US should not be militarily strong, or that private companies would undermine the Armed Forces. Hence, the answer is (C)."}
