{"question": "At time 0, five jobs are available for execution on a single processor, with service times of 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 time units. Which of the following is the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs?: A) 50, B) 208/5, C) 92/5, D) 10", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs can be achieved by using the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. This scheduling algorithm starts execution with the job which has the shortest service time and then continues with the other tasks in ascending order of their service times.\n\nTherefore, execution sequence of tasks based on SJF is 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 15 -> 25.\n\nNow, completion time for each task is as follows:\n\nTask with 2 units: 2 (0 + 2)\nTask with 3 units: 5 (2 + 3)\nTask with 5 units: 10 (5 + 5)\nTask with 15 units: 25 (10 + 15)\nTask with 25 units: 50 (25 + 25)\n\nTo calculate the average completion time, you add the completion times of all the tasks and divide by the number of tasks:\n\n(2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50) / 5 = 92 / 5\n\nThus, the minimum average completion time of these jobs is 92 / 5 time units (C)."}
