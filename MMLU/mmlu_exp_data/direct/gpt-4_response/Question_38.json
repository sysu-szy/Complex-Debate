{"question": "Which of the following samples would be considered most representative of male college students?: A) A group of thirty fraternity brothers from Penn State, B) A random sample taken between classes in the business wing of various universities, C) Sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia, D) Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The most representative sample would be (D) Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities. This is because it includes a wide variety of male college students from different locations, disciplines, and college sizes. This sample offers a broader representation of male college students compared to the other options which are limited based on fraternity membership, business majors, or elite Ivy League universities which do not adequately capture the diversity of male college students."}
