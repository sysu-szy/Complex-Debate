{"question": "Adequate serum levels of calcium are maintained in humans by the secretion of: A) thyroxine, B) glucagon, C) growth hormone, D) parathyroid hormone", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Adequate serum levels of calcium are maintained in humans by the secretion of parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid glands secrete this hormone in response to low blood calcium levels. Parathyroid hormone works to increase blood calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bone, increasing the absorption of calcium in the intestine, and increasing the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) parathyroid hormone."}
