{"question": "Which of the following statements are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models?\n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant: A) (ii) and (iv) only, B) (i) and (iii) only, C) (i), (ii), and (iii) only, D) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "All four statements are true with respect to the Box-Jenkins methodology for ARMA models:\n\n(i) The tests do show whether the presumed model is either too expansive or too limited. If the model is too simple, the residual autocorrelations usually remain substantially different from zero at some lag(s). If the model is too large, some of the estimated parameters can be statistically insignificant.\n\n(ii) The diagnostic tests involved in Box-Jenkins methodology include testing the model residuals for autocorrelation, non-normality, and heteroscedasticity.\n\n(iii) If the model selected at the identification stage is indeed suitable, then the autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) for the residuals should illustrate no additional structure, effectively appearing as white noise.\n\n(iv) And finally, if the model proposed during the identification stage is accurate, then the coefficients on any additional variables, typically included through the overfitting approach, will be statistically insignificant. This is because the extra variables should not add any explanatory power to the model beyond what is already captured by the earlier variables.\n\nBased on these considerations, the correct answer is (D) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)."}
