{"question": "A solution of sulfurous acid, H2SO3, is present in an aqueous solution. Which of the following represents the concentrations of three different ions in solution?: A) [SO32-] > [HSO3-] > [H2SO3], B) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-], C) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-], D) [SO32-] = [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]", "answer": "B", "agents_response": "In an aqueous solution, sulfurous acid (H2SO3) will partially dissociate to form HSO3- and H+ ions. This is the first ionization step and it usually has a larger equilibrium constant than the second ionization step. In the second ionization step, HSO3- will further dissociate into SO32- and H+ ions.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the original acid (H2SO3) will be higher than its singly ionized form (HSO3-), and the concentration of HSO3- will be higher than its doubly ionized form (SO32-).\n\nSo the correct answer is: B) [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]. (B)"}
