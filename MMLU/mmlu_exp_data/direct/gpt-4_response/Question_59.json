{"question": "What is the Cassini division of Saturn's rings?: A) a dark ring visible from Earth composed of dark dusty particles, B) the most opaque ring of Saturn made of highly reflective ice particles, C) the widest ring of Saturn located between two large ring gaps, D) a large gap visible from Earth produced by an orbital resonance with the moon Mimas", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "The Cassini Division of Saturn's rings is a large gap visible from Earth produced by an orbital resonance with the moon Mimas. Named after the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini who discovered it in 1675, it is approximately 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles) wide and is caused by gravitational interactions between Saturn's moon Mimas and the particles in the rings. These interactions create what's called an \"orbital resonance\" where the particles' orbits around Saturn sync up in a way that creates a gap in the rings. Therefore, the correct answer is D) a large gap visible from Earth produced by an orbital resonance with the moon Mimas. (D)"}
