{"question": "How many bits are required to store one BCD digit ?: A) 1, B) 2, C) 3, D) 4", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight. Since BCD is a way to represent decimal numbers (0-9) in binary form, it requires 4 bits. Thus, answer is D) 4. (D)"}
