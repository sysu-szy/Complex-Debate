{"question": "Which of the following statements is true?: A) The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, B) The Human Rights Act 1998 allows a court to invalidate primary legislation, C) The Human Rights Act 1998 allows any person with a reasonable case to bring a case before a court, D) The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the EU charter of fundamental rights into UK law", "answer": "A", "agents_response": "The correct statement is A) The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. The Human Rights Act 1998 was enacted to integrate the rights defined in the ECHR into UK law, allowing UK courts to hear human rights cases. Statement B) is incorrect because the act doesn't allow a court to invalidate primary legislation, but it can issue a declaration of incompatibility if a UK law is found to be incompatible with the rights outlined in the ECHR. Statement C) is somewhat true, as any individual who believes his/her rights under the ECHR have been violated can bring a case, but the 'reasonable' requirement is a subjective judgment. Lastly, statement D) is incorrect as the act does not incorporate the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. (A)"}
