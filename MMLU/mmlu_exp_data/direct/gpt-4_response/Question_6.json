{"question": "Averaging the output of multiple decision trees helps _.: A) Increase bias, B) Decrease bias, C) Increase variance, D) Decrease variance", "answer": "D", "agents_response": "Averaging the output of multiple decision trees helps to decrease variance. This technique is a part of ensemble methods. By averaging, the model becomes more robust and less susceptible to fluctuations in the training data. It's the principle behind techniques like Bagging and Random Forests where multiple trees are created and then the output is averaged to create a more steady, reliable prediction. Hence, the answer is (D) Decrease variance."}
