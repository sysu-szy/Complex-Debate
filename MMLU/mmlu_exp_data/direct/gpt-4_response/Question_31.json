{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following letter.\nIt happened . . . that a Spaniard saw an Indian . . . eating a piece of flesh taken from the body of an Indian who had been killed. . . . I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following superior technologies was most crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World?: A) New sailing technologies like the compass and the astrolabe, B) New ships like the carrack and caravel, C) Weapons like cannon and war horses, D) Better educational systems that taught navigation and warfare", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The superior technology most crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World was (C) Weapons like cannon and war horses. While new sailing technologies and ships played a pivotal role for the Europeans to reach the New World, and better educational systems did allow them a better understanding of navigation and warfare, it was ultimately their superior weaponry that ensured their domination. The firepower of cannons and the mobility and intimidation factor offered by war horses provided significant advantages over the indigenous populations who lacked such technology, enabling the Europeans not just to survive in a new and harsh environment, but to conquer it."}
