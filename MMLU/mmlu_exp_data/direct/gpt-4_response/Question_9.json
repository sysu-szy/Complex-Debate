{"question": "A state has enacted an abortion statute in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting interests involved when a woman chooses to terminate a pregnancy by abortion. The state's statute provided that during the first trimester of pregnancy, a woman's right to choose to terminate the pregnancy was paramount and could not be restricted in any manner. After the first trimester, the right of a woman to obtain an abortion was limited to cases where it was demonstrated by a physician that an abortion was necessary to protect the life or health of the woman seeking the abortion. In all likelihood, this abortion statute is: A) constitutional, because the state's statutestrikes a proper balance between the fundamental right of a woman to choose to terminatea pregnancy by abortion and the due processright to life of the unborn child., B) constitutional, because the state's statute issubstantially related to the important stateinterest in protecting the health and life of themother., C) unconstitutional, because the state's statuteimposes an undue burden on the right to obtainan abortion., D) unconstitutional, because it isirrational to impose virtually norestrictions on the right to obtain anabortion in the first trimester whileimposing significant restrictionson the right to obtain an abortionthereafter.", "answer": "C", "agents_response": "The most likely answer is (C) unconstitutional, because the state's statute imposes an undue burden on the right to obtain an abortion. This is a complex issue that hinges on precedents set by the Supreme Court of the United States in landmark rulings such as Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Roe v. Wade, the Court decided that during the first trimester, a state cannot regulate abortion beyond requiring that the procedure be performed by a licensed doctor in medically safe conditions. In the second trimester, the state's interest expands to potential regulations to protect the mother's health. In the third trimester, when the fetus becomes viable, states can regulate or absolutely ban abortions, except when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court affirmed Roe, but allowed states to regulate abortion access so long as those regulations do not impose an \"undue burden\" on a woman seeking an abortion. An undue burden is defined as having \"the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion\". Hence, if a state law is limiting the right to an abortion to only cases where the woman's life or health is at risk during the second trimester, it would likely be seen as imposing an undue burden.
