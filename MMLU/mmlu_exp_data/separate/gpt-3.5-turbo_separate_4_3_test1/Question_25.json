Grunig and Hunt's model of public relations emphasizes the importance of understanding and engaging with stakeholders who are affected by an organization's actions. They argue that successful communication and relationship-building with all relevant publics, even those who may not seem immediately important, is essential for maintaining a positive reputation and avoiding potential conflicts.
