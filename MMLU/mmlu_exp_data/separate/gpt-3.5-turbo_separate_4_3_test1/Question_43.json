Deciduous trees shed their leaves in the fall as a way to conserve energy during the cold winter months. This adaptation allows the trees to survive the harsh winter conditions by going dormant and then regrowing their leaves in the spring when the weather becomes more favorable. In contrast, desert biomes have plants that have adapted to conserve water in a different way, tundra biomes have trees that do not shed their leaves at all due to the short growing season, and taiga biomes have coniferous trees that keep their needles year-round.

Deciduous trees shed their leaves as a survival strategy to conserve water and energy during the cold and harsh winter months.
