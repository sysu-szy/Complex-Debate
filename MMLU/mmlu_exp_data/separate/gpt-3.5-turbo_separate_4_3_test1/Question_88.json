In fact, securitization theory is often praised for providing a framework that allows for a more nuanced understanding of security issues and for its ability to transcend traditional security studies. By focusing on the process of securitization, the theory highlights the importance of how certain issues are constructed as security threats and how this construction shapes policy responses. This can be seen as an advantage rather than a criticism, as it encourages a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach to security analysis.
