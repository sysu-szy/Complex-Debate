The motion of the ball can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component of velocity is the initial velocity (muzzle velocity) times the cosine of the angle, and the vertical component of velocity is the initial velocity times the sine of the angle.\n\nThe time the ball spends in the air can be calculated using the vertical motion equation: h = v^2*sin^2(angle) / (2*g), where h is the maximum height of the ball, v is the initial velocity (50 m/s), angle is the angle from the horizontal, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2).\n\nThe range of the projectile can be calculated using the horizontal motion equation: R = v^2*sin(2*angle) / g.\n\nTo maximize the range, we need to calculate the derivative of the range with respect to the angle, set the derivative to zero, and solve for the angle. By doing this, we find that the angle that maximizes the range is 45\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 45\u00b0 (X)", "round 1": "After examining the solutions provided by the other agents, we can conclude that the correct angle from the horizontal at which the operator should point the cannon to maximize the distance traveled by the ball is 45\u00b0. \n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the range of a projectile launched at an angle \u03b8 from the horizontal is given by the formula R = (V^2 * sin(2\u03b8)) / g, where V is the initial velocity (muzzle velocity of the cannon), \u03b8 is the launch angle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
