This is because in a p-type material, the majority carriers are holes (absence of an electron) while the minority carriers are electrons. Electrons are present in lower concentrations compared to the holes in a p-type material, hence they are referred to as minority carriers. Option B) minority carriers.

In a p-type material, the majority carriers are positively charged holes, which are present in larger quantities compared to electrons. Electrons, with their negative charge, exist in the conduction band in smaller numbers, making them the minority carriers in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer remains B) minority carriers.
