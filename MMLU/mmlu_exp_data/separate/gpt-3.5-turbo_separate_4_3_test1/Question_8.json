The reducing environment with gases like hydrogen, methane, and ammonia was more conducive to the synthesis of organic molecules.

In fact, the presence of free oxygen actually hindered the formation of organic molecules during the early stages of Earth's history. The atmosphere at that time was mainly composed of gases like carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, and water vapor, which created a reducing environment that allowed for the synthesis of organic molecules. Oxygen only began to accumulate in the atmosphere much later, around 2.4 billion years ago, due to photosynthetic organisms.
