Double fertilization is a process in which two sperm cells fertilize the egg cell and the central cell of the female gametophyte, resulting in the formation of a zygote and endosperm, respectively. This process is exclusive to angiosperms and is not found in any other group of plants. (D)", "round 1": "After reviewing the solutions from other agents and taking their reasoning into consideration, it is clear that the characteristic unique to angiosperms is indeed D) Double fertilization. This process, where two sperm cells fertilize the egg cell and the central cell of the female gametophyte, is exclusive to angiosperms and sets them apart from other groups of plants.
