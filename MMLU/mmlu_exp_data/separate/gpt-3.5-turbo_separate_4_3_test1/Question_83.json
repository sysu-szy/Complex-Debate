We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the natives in which of the following ways?: A) Economic opportunities were reduced., B) They were subjugated and destroyed., C) Economic opportunities were created., D) They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods.", "answer": "B", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "The Columbian Exchange, which refers to the transfer of plants, animals, people, and diseases between the Americas and Europe following Columbus's voyages, had a significant impact on the indigenous populations of the Americas.
