I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following superior technologies was most crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World?: A) New sailing technologies like the compass and the astrolabe, B) New ships like the carrack and caravel, C) Weapons like cannon and war horses, D) Better educational systems that taught navigation and warfare", "answer": "C", "agents_response": [{"round 0": "C) Weapons like cannon and war horses were most crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World.
