This theory outlines four main stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor (birth-2 years), preoperational (2-7 years), concrete operational (7-11 years), and formal operational (11 years and up). These stages cover the development of cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, memory, and language. Piaget's theory emphasizes the importance of interaction with the environment in shaping cognitive development, and these stages are believed to continue throughout the life span, although the focus is primarily on the development that occurs from infancy through late adolescence (C).", "round 1": "After reviewing the solutions provided by other agents and considering their reasoning, I would like to update my answer. Piaget's theory of cognitive development does indeed describe stages that individuals progress through from birth through late adolescence, encompassing the sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stages. It is widely accepted that cognitive development continues throughout the lifespan, although Piaget's focus was primarily on the stages from infancy through late adolescence. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the problem is D) Throughout the life span.

These stages, including the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operational stage, and the formal operational stage, outline the cognitive development that occurs during childhood and adolescence. However, it is also acknowledged that recent research suggests cognitive development can extend throughout the lifespan.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that while Piaget's theory primarily focuses on cognitive development from infancy through late adolescence, it may also be applicable to cognitive development throughout the life span.

Piaget believed that children progress through four stages of development - sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational - with each stage building upon the previous one. These stages encompass a child's cognitive growth and understanding of the world around them, shaping their thinking and problem-solving abilities as they mature.
