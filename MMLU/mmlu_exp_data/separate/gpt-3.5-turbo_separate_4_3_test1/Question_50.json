(B)", "round 1": "Based on the information provided by other agents, it is clear that colchicine is the agent that will induce polyploidy in a dividing eukaryote. Colchicine disrupts the formation of spindle fibers during cell division, leading to the production of cells with extra sets of chromosomes.

Colchicine disrupts the normal formation of spindle fibers during cell division, leading to the production of cells with extra sets of chromosomes, resulting in polyploidy. Furthermore, all other agents (Penicillin, Tetracycline, and Puromycin) do not have the same effect on inducing polyploidy in eukaryotic cells.

Colchicine works by interfering with the process of mitosis, specifically by disrupting the formation of the mitotic spindle fibers. This disruption leads to the failure of chromosome separation during cell division, resulting in cells with multiple sets of chromosomes, known as polyploid cells.\n\nPenicillin, Tetracycline, and Puromycin do not have any known effects on inducing polyploidy in eukaryotic cells.\n\nOverall, colchicine is the agent that is specifically known for inducing polyploidy in dividing eukaryotes.
