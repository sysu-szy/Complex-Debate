In this case, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, so for two hours of tutoring, her total value is $100. However, she agrees to tutor David for $125 for two hours, so her producer surplus is $25 ($125 - $100).\n\nConsumer surplus, on the other hand, is the difference between the price a consumer is willing to pay and the price they actually pay. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but he only pays $125. Therefore, his consumer surplus is $50 ($175 - $125).\n\nSince the producer surplus ($25) is greater than the consumer surplus ($50), the correct answer is B) Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75.
