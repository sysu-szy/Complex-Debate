This sample is more likely to provide a diverse representation of male college students as it includes individuals from different universities and academic disciplines. Fraternity brothers from Penn State (option A) may not be representative of all male college students as they come from a specific subgroup within one university. Similarly, selecting students from prestigious Ivy League schools (option C) may not be representative of the majority of male college students.
