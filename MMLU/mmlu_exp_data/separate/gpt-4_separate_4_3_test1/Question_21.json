However, indirectly, through the process of model identification, parameter estimation, and diagnostic checking, it can provide insights into whether the model is appropriately specified. There's a balance to be found in model specification, as a model that is too simple may leave systematic effects in the residuals, whereas a model that is too complex risks overfitting and poor generalizability to new data.\n\n(ii) Absolutely true.
