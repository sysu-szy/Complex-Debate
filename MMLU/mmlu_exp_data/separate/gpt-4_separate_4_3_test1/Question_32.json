This transformation from hunting and gathering to agriculture is estimated to have taken place roughly 10,000 years ago. Human groups began to settle, domesticate plants, breed animals for food and labor, and produce surplus food. This change brought on the development of more complex societies and advancements in technology. Prior to this period, there's little evidence to suggest that humans were significantly controlling their food sources beyond basic foraging and hunting practices. Therefore, the start of active and artificial control of food sources by humans should be within the past 12,000 years (B).", "round 1": "In examining the solutions presented by the other agents, it is clear that there is general consensus that the Neolithic Revolution, occurring approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, represented a significant shift in human behavior whereby humans began to actively control their food sources via agriculture. Prior to this event, humans were mainly nomadic hunter-gatherers with little evidence of sustained control over their food sources. \n\nAgent solution0 lays out similar reasoning to my own, referencing archaeological evidence to suggest that this active control of food production began about 12,000 years ago with the advent of agriculture and animal domestication.\n\nAgent solution1 provides additional geographic context for the agricultural shift, pointing out that while the Neolithic Revolution began roughly 10,000 to 12,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, the transition did not occur simultaneously worldwide but spread gradually.\n\nAgent solution2 adds a crucial point, making us cognizant of ongoing archaeological research exploring possible older cultivation practices. But they agree that major societal changes associated with controlled food production primarily align with the start of the Neolithic Revolution.\n\nThese lines of thought reinforce and expand upon my initial reasoning, which linked the onset of controlled food production with the Neolithic Revolution, estimated to have begun about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.\n\nTherefore, consolidating these perspectives, and protecting our intellectual humility; we need to consider potential earlier evidence but also weigh that our most accepted understanding points to the Neolithic Revolution.

Each of the agents refers to the Neolithic Revolution, a transformational event in human history approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, as the period when humans began taking active control over their food sources.\n\nAgent solution0 emphasizes the significance of the shift from hunting and gathering to the deliberate cultivation of plants and domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution, occurring around 12,000 years ago. This shift was a major step in controlled food production, corresponding with settlements in the Fertile Crescent, a highly productive region in early human evolution.\n\nAgent solution1 further bolsters this argument, recognizing the profound societal implications of the Neolithic Revolution and the onset of agriculture. Despite the possibility of earlier sporadic cultivation practices, the systematic and artificial control over food sources is largely credited to this period in human history.\n\nAgent solution2 concurs with this line of reasoning, highlighting that though there may have been minor levels of plant cultivation prior to the Neolithic Revolution, the establishment of agriculture as a strategic and planned process primarily corresponds with this significant era. The agent also notes the gradual spread of these practices across regions over time.\n\nThus, reinforcing my initial conclusion, I remain aligned with the majority consensus that the human groups began actively controlling their food sources by artificially creating conditions for them to grow approximately (B) within the past 12,000 years. This conclusion is primarily rooted in the historical implications of the Neolithic Revolution and the crucial shift it represented in human development. \n\nTherefore, after critically reviewing the agents' inputs and my deductive reasoning from both the mathematical and historical standpoint, my updated answer remains (B) within the past 12,000 years."}, {"round 0": "Archaeological evidence suggests that human groups began actively controlling their food sources through agricultural activities about 12,000 years ago, during the Neolithic Revolution.

This cultivation and breeding of plants and animals for human use defined the beginning of permanent human settlement and growth of civilization. Thus, the onset of control over food sources aligns with the rise of agriculture during this era. So, the answer would be (B) within the past 12,000 years.", "round 1": "Given the consensus among the agents' solutions, I believe my initial answer remains the same - that humans started actively controlling their food sources around 12,000 years ago. \n\nTo reiterate, the paradigm shift of humans' food procurement methods from hunting-gathering to deliberate agriculture, known as the Neolithic Revolution, is a crucial determinant in the timeline of humans controlling their food sources. The Neolithic Revolution, starting approximately 12,000 years ago, was characterized by the domestication of plants and animals, allowing humans to influence their food sources actively and deliberately. Evidence of this transition exists primarily in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle-East, a region known for being a powerhouse of early human development and progress.\n\nOur discussion revolves around the 'active control' and 'artificial production conditions' of food sources, which are crucial components of farming and agriculture. While earlier isolated instances of plant cultivation may have occurred, it was during the Neolithic Revolution that substantial, widespread, and systematic agricultural practices began. The advent of these practices means human societies could consistently control their food production, leading to surplus food, increased populations, permanent settlements, and complex societies.\n\nIt's also noteworthy that this transition didn't occur simultaneously worldwide; instead, it spread out across regions over time, with the Fertile Crescent as the likely epicenter. The time frame mentioned, i.e., 12,000 years ago, is thus a rough estimation of the onset of the systemic and collective agricultural practice.

This claim is backed by archaeological findings that align the beginning of systemic agriculture with the Neolithic Revolution.\n\nAgent solution1 gives geographical context, playing a pivotal role in our timeline. They indicate, like myself, that the Fertile Crescent was where the Neolithic Revolution began, but concede that the practice of agriculture spread gradually across the world. This supports our general timeline but also emphasises its rough nature.\n\nAgent solution2 adds a valuable aspect - the ongoing research in archaeological studies. New evidence points to older, primitive cultivation practices but still aligns the major societal changes like population growth and complex societies with the Neolithic Revolution, reinforcing the 10,000 to 12,000-year timeline.\n\nTo summarise, while historical data and archaeological evidence indicate that isolated instances of plant cultivation may have occurred before the Neolithic Revolution, it is only during this period that we see the wider, systematic application of agricultural practices emerge. These practices allowed for population growth and societal complexities, hallmarks of human evolution. Thus, it seems appropriate to maintain the timeframe set within the past 12,000 years as the period when human groups started to actively control their food sources by artificially creating conditions for growth. \n\nThus, given the additional insights and context provided by the other agents and re-evaluating my initial position, the answer remains (B) within the past 12,000 years."}, {"round 0": "The widespread development and implementation of agriculture - the deliberate production of crops and tending of livestock - can be traced back to the Neolithic Revolution.
