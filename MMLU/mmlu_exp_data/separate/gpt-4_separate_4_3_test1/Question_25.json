It is the fundamental element of the Four-Model Theory proposed by James E Grunig and Todd Hunt in 1984. The four models consisted of press agentry/publicity, public information, two-way asymmetric, and two-way symmetric. They suggested that organizations should identify and communicate with those publics who could be affected by the organization's activities or decisions or who could influence the organization. If a certain public is not impacted by or does not impact the organization, then practitioners do not need to consider them in their communications.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this debate is D) Grunig and Hunt (1984). (D)", "round 1": "Upon further examination of the solutions provided by the other agents and understanding their rationale, I remain convinced that Grunig and Hunt's theory correlates with the statement in question. Their Theory of Publics insists that those 'publics' which are not affected by or do not affect an organization do not need to be taken into account in communication strategies. This approach allows organizations to optimize their resources, enhance productivity and focus on matters that directly remain within the sphere of their influence and interest.\n\nHowever, it's also worth mentioning that this perspective is not absolute and depends on the context and timeline. For instance, a certain public may not be affected now but may become relevant in the future due to changes in an organization\u2019s activities or external factors such as changes in regulations or societal norms. Therefore, while organizations may prioritize communication with affected publics, they should still monitor and keep an openness towards other potential publics.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument that if an organization did not affect a public then there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications was made by Grunig and Hunt in 1984 in their comprehensive work on public relations theory and models. Thus, the answer remains (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984). (D)", "round 2": "After further evaluating my fellow agents' solutions, my conviction remains steadfast that the answer to the given problem is (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984). The responses from the other agents largely confirmed my initial assessment, consistently pointing towards Grunig and Hunt's public relations theories as the source of this thinking.\n\nAgent_0 presented an insightful analysis of Grunig and Hunt's Four-Model Theory and 'situational theory of publics'. Both concepts suggest that an organization need not communicate with a public that does not affect it or is not affected by it. This analysis affirms my initial stance.\n\nAgent_1's solution emphasized Grunig and Hunt's two-way symmetric model, asserting the value of reciprocal understanding between organizations and their respective publics. This model further reinforces Grunig and Hunt's argument that communications should primarily consider those publics that affect or are affected by the organization.\n\nAgent_2, too, aligned with my initial argument, directly attributing the assertion to Grunig and Hunt's work, 'Managing Public Relations'. They expanded on the situational theory of publics and explained how the role of a public is contingent upon its capacity to impact or be impacted by an organization's actions.\n\nIn summary, the collective reasoning from my counterparts has fortified my conclusion that the proposition - if an organization did not affect a public then there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications - was argued by Grunig and Hunt. Therefore, I reconfirm my answer to be (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984)."}, {"round 0": "This perspective was put forward by Grunig and Hunt in 1984. They are widely credited for the development of the four models of Public Relations, including the two-way symmetric model, which focuses on mutual understanding between an organization and its publics. They believed that an organization should only consider a public in its communications if that particular public is affected by the organization's operations in some way; otherwise, it's not necessary to consider them. This way, the organization can focus its resources on the publics that matter to its success. So, the correct answer is (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984).", "round 1": "Reflecting on the reasoning from other agents and incorporating further examination of the issue, my revised answer maintains that the perspective arguing the exclusivity of communication with publics affected by an organization's operations is attributed to Grunig and Hunt.\n\nIn their prolific work in 1984, Grunig and Hunt structured the theoretical understanding of Public Relations into four distinct models, including the significant two-way symmetric model. This model emphasizes the importance of reciprocal communication between an organization and its publics to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nMoreover, they championed the situational theory of publics, positioning that people become publics not inherently but due to situational influences particularly when they stand impacted by or able to impact an organization. Therefore, in accordance to this theory, if a certain public holds no potential to be affected by or effect an organization, that public need not be considered in the organization's communication strategies.\n\nFurthermore, this approach aligns with systems theory within Public Relations, providing another rationale for prioritizing communication with only those publics that are interrelated with an organization's activities or decisions. The relevance of a public is thus not universal but contingent upon specific influences, facilitating a more targeted and efficient communication strategy.\n\nGiven these points derived from the collective reasoning and extensive examination, the answer remains as (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984).", "round 2": "Taking into account the arguments of the other agents along with my original solution, I am largely in agreement with their points of view. We all seem to recognize the significance of Grunig and Hunt's situational theory of publics and their emphasis on focusing communication on publics directly impacted by or impacting an organization. This consensus across all agents reinforces my initial answer. \n\nAgent 0 added value by highlighting the potential fluidity of a 'public's' status over time due to changes in organizational activities or societal contexts. This perspective is aligned with the situational theory of publics, as it underscores the dynamic nature of an organization's publics.\n\nAgent 1 emphasized on Grunig and Hunt's two-way symmetric model, which emphasizes mutual understanding and communication between an organization and its impacted publics. This supplements my argument by underscoring the associated importance of two-way communication in ensuring organizations effectively prioritize their interested publics.\n\nAgent 2 provided reinforcement by linking the concept with the systems theory of public relations, creating a nuanced understanding of Grunig and Hunt's position. While it does not significantly shift the answer, it provides richer context to Grunig and Hunt's theory.\n\nIn conclusion, all arguments point towards Grunig and Hunt as the developers of this idea. They argued that if an organization did not affect a public, there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications. Thus, I stand firm and maintain my answer, it's (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984)."}, {"round 0": "The argument that if an organization did not affect a public then there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications was made by Grunig and Hunt.

Therefore, if an organization does not affect a certain public, then it does not need to consider that public in its communication strategies (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984).", "round 1": "After reviewing the solutions provided by other agents and applying critical thinking, I maintain my initial position that if an organization does not affect a public, there is no need for it to consider that public in its communications. Our understanding of this concept is rooted in the 'situational theory of publics', conceptualized by Grunig and Hunt in 1984.\n\nIn bolstering my argument, Agent 0A highlighted Grunig and Hunt's Four-Model Theory. This theory underpins the idea of selective consideration of publics in an organization's communication. Further, agent 0A discussed how organizations should focus on publics that could influence or be affected by them. This point complements my initial reasoning and provides a broader understanding of Grunig and Hunt's approach to public relations.\n\nAgent 1 emphasized the significance of the two-way symmetric model in Grunig and Hunt's theory. This model underscores the value of mutual understanding between an organization and its publics. Aligning with my original argument, this point reiterates the idea that if a public is not affected by or affecting an organization, there is no reason to include them in the organization's communication.\n\nAgent 2 pointed out that this concept is part of the systems theory approach of public relations. This is indeed insightful, but since this approach is based on the theories proposed by Grunig and Hunt, it doesn't alter the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and incorporating the insights offered by the other agents, I uphold my initial solution, which is (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984).", "round 2": "Upon reevaluation of the solutions given by other agents and their well-founded arguments, I find myself in agreement with their conclusions. Essential-informing references to Grunig and Hunt's situational theory of publics, the Four-Model theory, and the systems theory approach of Public Relations further support my initial stance.\n\nAgent solution0 rightly points out the practical implications of this theory, advocating for a resource optimization perspective. The need for organizations to strategically focus their communication resources on publics directly relevant to their operation, considering the current situation as well as potential future changes, gets underscored. \n\nAgent solution1 strengthens the argument, referencing the two-way symmetric model, which enforces the importance of mutual communication between an organization and its publics along with the situational theory. These theories collectively make a case for focusing communication on publics directly entangled with an organization's operation.\n\nAgent solution2 harmonizes with my original point of view and those of others, by debating Grunig and Hunt's contribution to the system theory approach of Public Relations. \n\nBuilding upon these views from other agents, it's necessary to understand that despite limiting communication to affected publics, it should not dismiss the significance of potential future interaction with other publics. While current relevance is prioritized, it is critical to stay open to evolving relationships with other publics due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nTherefore, integrating these observations from the viewpoints of all the agents along with my analysis of the situation, it only solidifies my previous solution that the argument \"if an organization did not affect a public, there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications,\" was postulated by (D) Grunig and Hunt in 1984."}, {"round 0": "This idea originated from the systems theory approach of public relations, arguing that if a public is not affected by or does not affect an organization, it can be ignored in the organization's communication strategies.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Grunig and Hunt (1984).", "round 1": "After reviewing the given problem and considering the additional solutions provided by the other agents, I still maintain my stance that the scholars who argued, within the systems theory approach of public relations, that if an organization was not affected by a certain public then a practitioner did not need to include that public in their communications were Grunig and Hunt. They expounded on this in their 1984 publication \"Managing Public Relations\".\n\nAgent 0's solution corroborates this, adding some context on Grunig and Hunt's Four-Model Theory. This theory included an emphasis on identifying and communicating with those publics who are either impacted by the organization or who can impact the organization. According to their theory, any public that does not influence or isn't affected by the organization does not have to be considered.\n\nAgent 1's solution mirrors this stance, pointing out Grunig and Hunt's belief that the resources of an organization should be targeted towards those publics that are potentially influential or impacted, thereby validating the same scholars and their work as the source of the argument in the problem question.\n\nThe same position is further substantiated by Agent 2's solution that dwells on Grunig and Hunt's 'situational theory of publics'. According to this theory, the existence of a public is situational, coming into being only when they are affected by or can affect an organization's operations or decisions. Hence, a public that isn't impacted by an organization's course of action need not be a part of the organization's communication strategies.\n\nGiven these perspectives, it's apparent that all agents have a consensus about the roundabout, agreeing that Grunig and Hunt in 1984 are indeed the scholars who proposed the argument at hand.

The mention of the ability of publics to influence or be influenced by an organization mirrors my statement and supports the answer.\n\nAgent 1's solution similarly supports the notion that Grunig and Hunt argued for the selective inclusion of publics in an organization\u2019s communications. The point about the two-way symmetric model is noteworthy, as it is an essential part of Grunig and Hunt's theoretical contributions and aligns them with the argument in question.\n\nAgent 2's solution focuses on the 'situational theory of publics', part of Grunig and Hunt's contributions. This reasoning not only strengthens my initial stance but adds more depth to our understanding of their theories in the context of Public Relations.\n\nMy solution was rooted in Grunig and Hunt's significant systems theory approach of public relations. This theory, as discussed during this round, posits that publics not affected by or affecting the organization need not be included in the organization's communications, which is the essence of the problem in question.\n\nTo concur with the given perspectives and according to the rationale laid out by all the agents, including my assessment, the solution to this problem aligns with the argument put forth by Grunig and Hunt in their 1984 publication.
