The extent of this second ionization is less than the first ionization (due to the progressive reduction in the concentration of H+ \u2014 or technically aH+ since we are talking about ion activities rather than concentrations \u2014 making each subsequent ionization less favorable).\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the bisulfite ion, HSO3-, should be greater than that of the sulfite ion, SO32-.\n\nSo, the concentrations of the three species in solution would most correctly be represented as: [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-].\n\nAnswer: (B)", "round 1": "After careful review of the problem and consulting the conclusions reached by other agents, it's clear that the question addresses the reaction and equilibrium of a weak diprotic acid, sulfuric acid (H2SO3), in an aqueous solution.\n\nH2SO3 is a weak acid, which means that it doesn't completely ionize or dissociate in water. It would rather mostly stay in its molecular form, leading to the conclusion that the concentration of H2SO3 would remain higher in an aqueous solution.\n\nThis acid has two deprotonation steps. The first one produces the bisulfite ion (HSO3-):\n\nH2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\nAs explained, not all the acid undergoes this process as it is a weak acid. Thus, more undissociated H2SO3 will be present compared to HSO3-.\n\nFurther, the bisulfite ion (HSO3-) itself is a weak acid and can lose a proton to form the sulfite ion (SO32-):\n\nHSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nBut this second dissociation is less likely to occur than the first one. The reason is that producing more charged ions is less favorable, so we will have more bisulfite ions (HSO3-) than sulfite ions (SO32-).\n\nTo conclude and answer the question, in a solution of sulfurous acid, the highest concentration will be of the un-ionized H2SO3, followed by its first ionized form, the bisulfite ion (HSO3-) and then its second ionized form, the sulfite ion (SO32-).

Firstly, H2SO3 can donate a proton to form the bisulfite ion (HSO3-). But as a weak acid, H2SO3 only partially dissociates in the solution, meaning that its concentration will remain relatively high. The equation that depicts this step is:\n\nH2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\nThe second dissociation phase involves the bisulfite ion, which is itself a weak acid that can give up another proton to form the sulfite ion (SO32-). But similar to the first dissociation, this step is also only partial, leading to HSO3- being present in a higher concentration compared to SO32-. This step is depicted as follows:\n\nHSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nKeeping in mind the principles of equilibrium and understanding that increased ionization is less favored, the concentration of ions is higher for the molecular and weakly ionized stages than for the wholly ionized form.\n\nHence, building off my original solution and the additional insight gained from examining the solutions of other agents, I can confidently reaffirm that the correct order of concentration is [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-].
