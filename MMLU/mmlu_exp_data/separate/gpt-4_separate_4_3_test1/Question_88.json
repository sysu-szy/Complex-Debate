This is indeed one of the frequent objections to securitization theory.\n\nOption B focuses on the ambiguity of what constitutes an extraordinary measure when the securitizing actor isn\u2019t a state. While it seems that this is less commonly cited as direct criticism, it is inherently entwined with the nature of the securitization process itself, particularly when dealing with non-state actors. \n\nOption C delves into the problem of distinctive political and security realms not being clearly defined, providing another valid point of critique against the securitization model.\n\nSimilarly, option D's concern about the lack of coherence and consistency in the employment of the theory in analytical studies also points towards a valid common criticism of securitization theory.\n\nHowever, none of the listed criticisms stand out as less common based on the general discourse surrounding securitization. Therefore, it would seem that this question does not have a valid answer if we purely base the decision on the commonality of these criticisms within academic discussions about securitization. All aforementioned points are either directly critiqued or indirectly involved in the debates concerning securitization according to various academic literature.\n\nHence, the task of choosing which criticism is 'not common' becomes heavily reliant on subjective interpretation or specific context which isn't provided by the question.

This criticism, while seemingly less emphasized, is integral when addressing issues related to securitization not involving state actors. Hence, this point is indeed a common critique.\n\nOption C denotes the difficulty posed while differentiating political and security realms owing to a lack of clear definition within the model. This objection is agreed upon by most scholars, asserting it to be a common critique.\n\nLastly, Option D criticizes the lack of a coherent method when using the theory as an analytical tool pertaining to security studies, a common critique identified amongst scholars.\n\nTherefore, I echo the sentiment of Agents 1 and 2 stating each of these criticisms as common ones levied against the Securitization theory. Accordingly, the answer ought to read E) None of the above.

It is true that the 'actor' in 'securitization' is crucial, however, the ambiguity about an 'extraordinary measure' when the actor is not a state is not a standing criticism, as securitization theory does tend to provide for non-state actors' potential to securitize issues. \n\nThe lack of analytical coherence (Option D) also forms a common criticism as this theory requires further elaboration to serve as a comprehensive analytical tool.

Such responses underline the importance of understanding the premise of securitization, its practice, and the common criticisms scholars and practitioners level against it. \n\nI previously concluded that the common criticisms of the Securitization do include concerns around it having a loose and ambiguous definition (Option A), its lack of clarity when differentiating between political and security realms (Option C), and the lack of analytical coherence when employed as a tool in security studies (Option D).

Though it is clear that non-state actors do have the ability to securitize issues, the primary disagreements about securitization revolve around the broad conceptualization of security, differentiating between political and security realms, and its usefulness as an analytical tool.

Thus, A cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption C, concerning the difficulty of distinguishing between political and security realms, and Option D, questioning the tool's reliability in analytical studies due to coherence issues, are also frequently mentioned in debates.\n\nAlthough my initial stance was to argue that Option B does not comprise a conventional criticism of securitization, the perspectives provided by Agent solution1 and Agent solution2 suggest that even Option B's criticism related to non-state actors taking extraordinary measures is well-debated in academic circles.\n\nIn light of all these inputs, I am inclined to reassess my initial response.

This discrepancy is likely due to varying interpretations of what exactly constitutes a common criticism, and the relative prevalence of this criticism in academic discourse. \n\nOption A, which grapples with the vagueness of the security concept, is undeniably a well-established criticism within the field.

This criticism informs many debates on the topic and is, therefore, indeed a common criticism.\n\nOption D, tackling the idea of securitization's lack of coherence as an analytical tool, is likewise considered a mainstream criticism. Many scholars have criticized the use of securitization in a range of analytical studies due to this issue.\n\nThe discrepancy lies with option B, which asserts the difficulty in defining what would be an extraordinary measure in contexts where the securitizing actor is not explicitly the state. Agent 1 believes this criticism is not as common since the securitization theory does accommodate the potential for non-state actors to securitize issues. \n\nHowever, my original examination solidifies the idea that this criticism is also commonly articulated. The concept of 'extraordinary measures', while a basic element of securitization, is less well-defined in the context of non-state actors. This lack of definition creates a level of uncertainty that is, in fact, a common point of contention within academic discussions.\n\nConsequently, my earlier stance is reinforced. There is no right answer among options A, B, C, and D, as all are indeed common criticisms of securitization. So, the answer should be presented as: (E) None of the above.

Evidently, this puts it out of the question.\n\nSimilarly, criticism C, which is about the lack of definitive delineation between the political and security realms, is visibly present in the academic literature, eliminating this option as well. \n\nOption D, which criticizes the employment of securitization as an analytical tool in security studies, due to perceived deficiencies in coherence and consistency, is held up in the same light by many academic scholars, ruling out this option as well.\n\nThe crux of the matter hangs on option B. While some agents hold it to be a less apparent critique, I initially viewed it as a common complaint amid academic discussions. The idea is that when the securitizing actor isn't the state, it becomes difficult to determine what constitutes an extraordinary measure.\n\nHowever, if option B is considered less prevalent as it's not the cornerstone of major debates surrounding Securitization, there could be a basis for regarding it as the least common criticism. Having considered the insight from the other agents, particularly Agent 1, I can understand their perspective and concede that option B may rank less when weighed against the frequency and prominence of critiques A, C, and D in academic discourse. \n\nNevertheless, concluding that option B is the correct answer based on it potentially being a less frequent criticism would remain speculative at best and lacks solid empirical backing.\n\nGiven the considerations, my updated conclusion is that, although all the points A, B, C, and D are valid criticisms, option B might be considered the least common one based on its potential lesser prevalence in academic discussions.
