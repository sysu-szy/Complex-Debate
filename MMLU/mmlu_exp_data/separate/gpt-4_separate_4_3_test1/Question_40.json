Although he was initially ordained in the Orthodox tradition, and taught at the Conservative movement's Jewish Theological Seminary for many years, Kaplan ultimately decided to start a new movement that could better express his evolving ideas about God, Jewish peoplehood, and religion. Kaplan's theology was distinctive because of his emphasis on Judaism as a civilization, and because of his conceptualization of God as a process or force in the universe, rather than a personal deity. These ideas, and others, form the basis for Reconstructionist Judaism, the only one of the listed sects founded by Kaplan. So the correct answer is D) Reconstructionist Judaism.

Mordechai Kaplan was indeed the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism movement. Kaplan strived to balance Jewish tradition with modern secular contexts, He stressed Judaism as a series of practices and beliefs that contributed to an evolving Jewish culture and civilization. He diverged from Orthodox Judaism to breed a fresh perspective on the Jewish faith. Kaplan's unique perspectives formed the foundation of Reconstructionist Judaism.

Kaplan's substantial shift from Orthodox ideologies to a holistic vision of Judaism stood out, marking him as a revolutionary figure in Jewish history.\n\nHis evolved understanding of Judaism as an evolving civilization, as opposed to just a religious practice, has been widely acknowledged. This pattern of belief was instrumental in the construction of the Reconstructionist Judaism movement and sharply distinguished it from Liberal Judaism, Reform Judaism, and Conservative Judaism.

The fact that Kaplan was ordained in the Orthodox tradition and contributed significantly to the Conservative movement doesn't detract from the fact that he was the primary founder of the Reconstructionist movement.

We all agree that the movement founded by Mordechai Kaplan is Reconstructionist Judaism. \n\nMordechai Kaplan, originally ordained in the Orthodox tradition and later affiliated with Conservative Judaism, was a monumental figure in 20th-century American Judaism. With his evolving thoughts about God, Jewish peoplehood, and religion, he eventually decided to create a new form of Judaism.
